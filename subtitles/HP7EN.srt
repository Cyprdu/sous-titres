1
00:02:33,488 --> 00:02:35,280
It's beautiful here.

2
00:02:36,366 --> 00:02:37,991
It was our aunt's.

3
00:02:38,368 --> 00:02:40,369
We used to come here as kids.

4
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:43,580
The Order uses it now as a safe house.

5
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,000
What's left of us, at least.

6
00:02:49,295 --> 00:02:53,382
Muggles think these keep evil away,
but they're wrong.

7
00:02:55,927 --> 00:02:57,803
I need to talk to the goblin.

8
00:03:09,691 --> 00:03:10,941
How are you?

9
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:14,444
Alive.

10
00:03:19,576 --> 00:03:20,909
You probably don't remember...

11
00:03:21,077 --> 00:03:24,246
That I showed you to your vault
the first time you came to Gringotts?

12
00:03:24,831 --> 00:03:27,958
Even amongst goblins you're famous,
Harry Potter.

13
00:03:31,713 --> 00:03:33,422
You buried the elf.

14
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,965
Yes.

15
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:36,842
And brought me here.

16
00:03:39,262 --> 00:03:40,554
You are...

17
00:03:42,473 --> 00:03:44,766
...a very unusual wizard.

18
00:03:52,275 --> 00:03:54,568
How did you come by this sword?

19
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:00,449
It's complicated.

20
00:04:02,535 --> 00:04:06,205
Why did Bellatrix Lestrange think it
should be in her vault at Gringotts?

21
00:04:07,582 --> 00:04:09,458
It's complicated.

22
00:04:12,754 --> 00:04:16,340
The sword presented itself to us
in a moment of need.

23
00:04:16,674 --> 00:04:18,258
We didn't steal it.

24
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:24,681
There is a sword in Madam Lestrange's
vault identical to this one...

25
00:04:24,849 --> 00:04:26,475
...but it is a fake.

26
00:04:26,643 --> 00:04:28,310
It was placed there this summer.

27
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:31,813
- And she never suspected it was a fake?
- The replica is very convincing.

28
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:35,859
Only a goblin would recognize
that this is the true sword of Gryffindor.

29
00:04:36,027 --> 00:04:37,736
Who is the acquaintance?

30
00:04:37,904 --> 00:04:42,366
A Hogwarts professor.
As I understand it, he's now headmaster.

31
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:44,201
Snape?

32
00:04:45,495 --> 00:04:47,913
He put a fake sword in Bellatrix's vault?

33
00:04:48,623 --> 00:04:49,665
Why?

34
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:54,419
There are more than a few curious things
in the vaults at Gringotts.

35
00:04:55,213 --> 00:04:58,340
And in Madam Lestrange's vault as well?

36
00:05:01,052 --> 00:05:02,219
Perhaps.

37
00:05:04,597 --> 00:05:08,016
I need to get into Gringotts.
Into one of the vaults.

38
00:05:08,685 --> 00:05:09,851
This is impossible.

39
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:13,939
Alone, yes. But with you, no.

40
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:20,529
Why should I help you?

41
00:05:20,697 --> 00:05:23,448
I have gold. Lots of it.

42
00:05:23,616 --> 00:05:26,660
- I have no interest in gold.
- Then what?

43
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:33,375
That.

44
00:05:34,002 --> 00:05:35,043
That is my price.

45
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,768
Are you thinking
there's a Horcrux in Bellatrix's vault?

46
00:05:51,936 --> 00:05:54,438
She was terrified when she
thought we'd been in there.

47
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:56,481
She kept asking you
what else we'd taken.

48
00:05:56,649 --> 00:05:59,568
I bet you there's a Horcrux in there,
another piece of his soul.

49
00:05:59,736 --> 00:06:02,696
Let's find it and kill it,
we're one step closer to killing him.

50
00:06:02,864 --> 00:06:04,656
And what happens when we find it?

51
00:06:04,824 --> 00:06:08,243
How are we supposed to destroy it
now you've given the sword to Griphook?

52
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:10,454
I'm still working on that part.

53
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,082
He's weak.

54
00:06:23,384 --> 00:06:25,093
Yes?

55
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:30,932
Mr. Ollivander, I need to ask you
a few questions.

56
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,894
Anything, my boy, anything.

57
00:06:34,854 --> 00:06:37,439
Would you mind identifying this wand?

58
00:06:37,607 --> 00:06:40,233
We need to know if it's safe to use.

59
00:06:46,157 --> 00:06:47,949
Walnut.

60
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:51,411
Dragon heartstring.

61
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:54,831
Twelve and three-quarter inches.

62
00:06:55,792 --> 00:06:57,626
Unyie...

63
00:06:59,712 --> 00:07:01,380
Unyielding.

64
00:07:02,465 --> 00:07:06,718
This belonged to Bellatrix Lestrange.

65
00:07:06,886 --> 00:07:09,679
Treat it carefully.

66
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:11,681
And this?

67
00:07:15,061 --> 00:07:16,978
Hawthorn.

68
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:20,899
And unicorn hair.

69
00:07:21,067 --> 00:07:25,737
Ten inches. Reasonably pliant.

70
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:33,829
This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.

71
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:37,040
Was? Is it not still?

72
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:41,336
Well, perhaps not, if you won it from him.

73
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:47,342
I sense its allegiance has changed.

74
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:56,935
You talk about wands
as if they have feelings...

75
00:07:58,855 --> 00:08:00,147
...can think.

76
00:08:03,526 --> 00:08:07,988
The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter.

77
00:08:08,531 --> 00:08:13,493
That much has always been clear
to those of us who have studied wandlore.

78
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:18,039
And what do you know
about the Deathly Hallows?

79
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:26,214
It is rumored there are three:

80
00:08:27,967 --> 00:08:30,051
The Elder Wand...

81
00:08:30,803 --> 00:08:36,057
...the Cloak of invisibility
to hide you from your enemies...

82
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:42,063
...and the Resurrection Stone
to bring back loved ones from the dead.

83
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:47,235
Together, they make one
the master of death.

84
00:08:47,403 --> 00:08:53,492
But few truly believe
that such objects exist.

85
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:55,327
Do you?

86
00:08:55,912 --> 00:08:58,079
Do you believe they exist, sir?

87
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:08,215
I see no reason to put stock
into an old wives' tale.

88
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:09,883
You're lying.

89
00:09:11,135 --> 00:09:13,345
You know one exists.

90
00:09:13,513 --> 00:09:15,347
You told him about it.

91
00:09:15,515 --> 00:09:21,061
You told him about the Elder Wand
and where he could go looking for it.

92
00:09:24,524 --> 00:09:26,650
He tortured me.

93
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:31,154
Besides...

94
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:34,866
...I only conveyed rumors.

95
00:09:36,619 --> 00:09:38,161
There's...

96
00:09:39,372 --> 00:09:42,541
There's no telling whether he will find it.

97
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:47,462
He has found it, sir.

98
00:09:53,344 --> 00:09:55,136
We'll let you rest.

99
00:09:57,682 --> 00:10:00,058
He's after you, Mr. Potter.

100
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,481
If it's true, what you say,
and he has the Elder Wand...

101
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:09,985
...I'm afraid...

102
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:13,488
...you really don't stand a chance.

103
00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:18,285
Well, I suppose I'll have to kill him
before he finds me, then.

104
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:25,709
Are you sure that's hers?

105
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:29,004
Positive.

106
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:36,678
Well?

107
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:39,598
How do I look?

108
00:10:39,974 --> 00:10:41,683
Hideous.

109
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:45,604
You can give that to Hermione to hold,
all right, Griphook?

110
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:06,625
We're relying on you.

111
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:10,837
If you get us past the guards
and into the vault, the sword's yours.

112
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:24,559
Madam Lestrange.

113
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:26,519
Good morning.

114
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:31,399
"Good morning"? "Good morning"?

115
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:34,694
You're Bellatrix Lestrange,
not some dewy-eyed school girl.

116
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:36,571
Hey. Easy.

117
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:41,284
She gives us away, we might as well
use that sword to slit our own throats.

118
00:11:41,452 --> 00:11:43,328
Understand?

119
00:11:43,496 --> 00:11:46,998
No, he's right. I was being stupid.

120
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:48,750
Okay.

121
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:50,669
Let's do it.

122
00:12:55,234 --> 00:12:58,194
I wish to enter my vault.

123
00:13:01,407 --> 00:13:03,658
Identification?

124
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:09,330
I hardly think that'll be necessary.

125
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:13,668
Madam Lestrange.

126
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:21,676
I don't like to be kept waiting.

127
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:23,261
They know.

128
00:13:23,429 --> 00:13:25,597
They know she's an imposter.

129
00:13:28,434 --> 00:13:30,226
They've been warned.

130
00:13:38,277 --> 00:13:39,861
Harry?

131
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:42,572
What do we do, Harry?

132
00:13:48,037 --> 00:13:51,998
Madam Lestrange,
would you mind presenting your wand?

133
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,167
And why should I do that?

134
00:13:54,335 --> 00:13:59,881
It's the bank's policy. I'm sure you
understand given the current climate.

135
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:03,218
No. I most certainly do not understand.

136
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:07,222
I'm afraid I must insist.

137
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:14,395
Imperio.

138
00:14:19,902 --> 00:14:24,072
Very well, Madam Lestrange.
If you will follow me.

139
00:15:00,276 --> 00:15:01,401
What is that, Griphook?

140
00:15:06,866 --> 00:15:08,199
Griphook.

141
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:29,679
Arresto momentum.

142
00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:34,684
Well done, Hermione.

143
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:44,861
Oh, no, you look like you again.

144
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:49,324
The Thief's Downfall.
Washes away all enchantments.

145
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:50,617
Can be deadly.

146
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,410
You don't say.

147
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:55,580
Just out of interest,
is there any other way out of here?

148
00:15:55,748 --> 00:15:57,415
No.

149
00:15:58,334 --> 00:16:02,295
What the devil are all you
doing down here?

150
00:16:02,463 --> 00:16:03,671
Thieves!

151
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,132
- When you gave up the keys, you...
- Imperio.

152
00:16:17,186 --> 00:16:19,395
That doesn't sound good.

153
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,157
Bloody hell.

154
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:32,659
That's a Ukrainian Ironbelly.

155
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:34,369
Here.

156
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:48,341
It's been trained to expect pain
when it hears the noise.

157
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:50,051
That's barbaric.

158
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:21,666
Lumos.

159
00:17:25,796 --> 00:17:27,338
Blimey.

160
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,597
Accio Horcrux.

161
00:17:38,142 --> 00:17:40,143
You're not trying that one again,
are you?

162
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:43,104
That kind of magic won't work in here.

163
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:49,318
Is it in here, Harry?

164
00:17:50,154 --> 00:17:51,612
Can you feel anything?

165
00:18:13,302 --> 00:18:15,928
That's it. Up there.

166
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:22,727
They've added the Gemino curse.
Everything you touch will multiply.

167
00:18:22,895 --> 00:18:24,353
Give me the sword.

168
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:44,040
Stop moving.

169
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:07,897
Got it.

170
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:12,151
We had a deal, Griphook.

171
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:13,694
The cup for the sword.

172
00:19:19,368 --> 00:19:24,372
I said I'd get you in. I didn't say
anything about getting you out.

173
00:19:45,978 --> 00:19:47,061
Griphook!

174
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:48,896
- Thieves! Help!
- Griphook!

175
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:50,898
Thieves!

176
00:19:53,569 --> 00:19:56,529
Foul little git.
Least we've still got Bogrod.

177
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:04,412
That's unfortunate.

178
00:20:09,418 --> 00:20:11,586
- We can't just stand here.
- Who's got an idea?

179
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:13,296
You're the brilliant one.

180
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:15,756
I've got something, but it's mad.

181
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:17,258
Reducto.

182
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:31,272
Well, come on, then.

183
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:35,985
Relashio.

184
00:21:22,658 --> 00:21:24,575
He's moving! Aah!

185
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:52,353
Now what?

186
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:53,854
Reducto.

187
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:56,482
Hold on.

188
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:09,912
That was brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.

189
00:22:37,232 --> 00:22:37,898
We're dropping.

190
00:22:41,987 --> 00:22:44,238
- I say we jump.
- When?

191
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:45,781
Now.

192
00:23:40,212 --> 00:23:43,172
He knows. You-Know-Who.

193
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,965
He knows we broke into Gringotts.

194
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:48,302
He knows what we took
and he knows we're hunting Horcruxes.

195
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,304
- How is it you know?
- I saw him.

196
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:52,932
You let him in? Harry, you can't do that.

197
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,644
Hermione, I can't always help it.
Well, maybe I can. I don't know.

198
00:23:56,812 --> 00:23:58,521
Never mind. What happened?

199
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:00,481
Well, he's angry.

200
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:02,233
And scared too.

201
00:24:02,401 --> 00:24:05,903
He knows if we find and destroy all
the Horcruxes we'll be able to kill him.

202
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:09,740
I reckon he'll stop at nothing
to make sure we don't find the rest.

203
00:24:10,951 --> 00:24:13,202
There's more. One of them's at Hogwarts.

204
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:15,079
What?

205
00:24:15,247 --> 00:24:17,915
- You saw it?
- I saw the castle and Rowena Ravenclaw.

206
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:20,668
It must have to do with her.
We have to go there now.

207
00:24:20,836 --> 00:24:24,130
We can't do that. We've got to plan.
We've got to figure it out.

208
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:27,425
Hermione, when have any of our plans
ever actually worked?

209
00:24:27,592 --> 00:24:30,010
We plan, we get there,
all hell breaks loose.

210
00:24:31,138 --> 00:24:32,388
He's right.

211
00:24:32,556 --> 00:24:36,809
- Snape's headmaster now.
- We can't just walk through the front door.

212
00:24:36,977 --> 00:24:41,730
Um, well, we'll go to Hogsmeade,
to Honeydukes.

213
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:44,233
Take the secret passage in the cellar.

214
00:24:44,401 --> 00:24:47,778
It's... There's something wrong with him.

215
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:52,283
It's like, you know, in the past, I've
always been able to follow his thoughts.

216
00:24:52,451 --> 00:24:55,327
And now everything
just feels disconnected.

217
00:24:55,495 --> 00:24:56,787
Maybe it's the Horcruxes.

218
00:24:56,955 --> 00:24:58,956
Maybe he's growing weaker.
Maybe he's dying.

219
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:02,251
No. No, it's more like he's wounded.

220
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:05,212
If anything, he feels more dangerous.

221
00:25:54,638 --> 00:25:56,597
- They're here!
- Search everywhere!

222
00:25:56,765 --> 00:25:58,015
- Look down by the stables!
- You two, come with me!

223
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:01,602
Any sign?

224
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:18,160
Potter!

225
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:32,883
In here, Potter.

226
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:48,357
Did you get a look at him?

227
00:26:48,525 --> 00:26:51,318
- For a second, I thought it was...
- I know. Dumbledore.

228
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,295
Harry?

229
00:27:11,298 --> 00:27:13,507
I can see you in this.

230
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:29,231
You bloody fools.
What were you thinking coming here?

231
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:31,692
Have you any idea how dangerous it is?

232
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:35,529
You're Aberforth, Dumbledore's brother.

233
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:37,865
It's you who I've been seeing in here.

234
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,326
You're the one who sent Dobby.

235
00:27:40,493 --> 00:27:41,785
Where have you left him?

236
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:43,537
He's dead.

237
00:27:44,122 --> 00:27:46,123
Sorry to hear it. I liked that elf.

238
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:49,209
Who gave that to you? The mirror?

239
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:52,046
Mundungus Fletcher, about a year ago.

240
00:27:52,213 --> 00:27:55,466
- Dung had no right. It belonged to...
Sirius.

241
00:27:55,967 --> 00:27:57,843
Albus told me.

242
00:27:58,428 --> 00:28:02,640
He also told me you'd likely be hacked off
if you ever found out I had it...

243
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:07,728
...but ask yourself,
where would you be if I didn't?

244
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:13,400
Do you hear from the others much?
From the Order?

245
00:28:13,568 --> 00:28:15,527
The Order's finished.

246
00:28:15,695 --> 00:28:17,071
You-Know-Who's won.

247
00:28:17,238 --> 00:28:20,616
Anyone who says otherwise
is kidding themselves.

248
00:28:20,784 --> 00:28:23,327
We need to get into Hogwarts, tonight.

249
00:28:23,745 --> 00:28:25,454
Dumbledore gave us a job to do.

250
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:27,289
Did he now?

251
00:28:27,457 --> 00:28:28,916
Nice job? Easy?

252
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,003
We've been hunting Horcruxes.

253
00:28:33,171 --> 00:28:36,590
We think the last one's inside the castle,
but we'll need help getting in.

254
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:40,469
That's not a job my brother's given you.
It's a suicide mission.

255
00:28:40,637 --> 00:28:44,014
Do yourself a favor, boy, go home.
Live a little longer.

256
00:28:44,182 --> 00:28:48,852
- Dumbledore trusted me to see this through.
- What makes you think you can trust him?

257
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,814
You think you can believe
anything my brother told you?

258
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:55,776
In all the time you knew him,
did he ever mention my name?

259
00:28:56,736 --> 00:28:58,862
Did he ever mention hers?

260
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:02,741
- Why should he...?
- Keep secrets? You tell me.

261
00:29:03,743 --> 00:29:07,246
- I trusted him.
- That's a boy's answer.

262
00:29:07,414 --> 00:29:10,499
A boy who goes chasing Horcruxes
on the word of a man...

263
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:13,419
...who wouldn't even tell him
where to start. You're lying!

264
00:29:14,087 --> 00:29:17,881
Not just to me, that doesn't matter.
To yourself as well.

265
00:29:18,049 --> 00:29:20,092
That's what a fool does.

266
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:24,138
You don't strike me as a fool,
Harry Potter.

267
00:29:24,305 --> 00:29:28,976
So I'll ask you again.
There must be a reason.

268
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:34,314
I'm not interested in what happened
between you and your brother.

269
00:29:35,024 --> 00:29:37,317
I don't care that you've given up.

270
00:29:39,738 --> 00:29:42,364
I trusted the man I knew.

271
00:29:45,493 --> 00:29:48,579
And we need to get into
the castle tonight.

272
00:29:53,835 --> 00:29:56,253
You know what to do.

273
00:30:02,844 --> 00:30:04,803
Where have you sent her?

274
00:30:05,263 --> 00:30:08,849
You'll see soon enough.

275
00:30:15,023 --> 00:30:17,816
That's your sister, Ariana, isn't it?

276
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:21,528
She died very young, didn't she?

277
00:30:22,447 --> 00:30:26,200
My brother sacrificed many things,
Mr. Potter...

278
00:30:26,367 --> 00:30:28,869
...on his journey to find power...

279
00:30:29,037 --> 00:30:31,288
...including Ariana.

280
00:30:31,706 --> 00:30:34,583
And she was devoted to him.

281
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:37,628
He gave her everything...

282
00:30:38,588 --> 00:30:40,339
...but time.

283
00:30:41,716 --> 00:30:44,092
Thank you, Mr. Dumbledore.

284
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:53,477
He did save our lives twice.

285
00:30:54,103 --> 00:30:56,271
Kept an eye on us in that mirror.

286
00:30:57,524 --> 00:31:00,567
That doesn't seem
like someone who's given up.

287
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,866
She's coming back.

288
00:31:08,618 --> 00:31:09,785
Who's that with her?

289
00:31:18,002 --> 00:31:19,086
Neville.

290
00:31:19,254 --> 00:31:21,755
- Oh, you look...
- Like hell, I reckon.

291
00:31:21,923 --> 00:31:24,550
This is nothing. Seamus is worse.

292
00:31:25,134 --> 00:31:28,762
Hey, Ab, we've got a couple more
coming through.

293
00:31:29,931 --> 00:31:31,807
Don't remember this
on the Marauder's Map.

294
00:31:31,975 --> 00:31:33,892
That's because it never existed till now.

295
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:37,312
The seven secret passages were sealed off
before the start of the year.

296
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,273
This is the only way in or out now.

297
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,067
The grounds are crawling with
Death Eaters and Dementors.

298
00:31:42,235 --> 00:31:43,944
How bad is Snape as headmaster?

299
00:31:44,112 --> 00:31:47,072
Hardly ever see him.
It's the Carrows you need to watch out for.

300
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,282
Carrows?

301
00:31:48,449 --> 00:31:50,909
Yeah. Brother and sister.
In charge of discipline.

302
00:31:51,077 --> 00:31:52,786
They like punishment, the Carrows.

303
00:31:52,954 --> 00:31:54,955
They did that to you? Why?

304
00:31:55,123 --> 00:31:58,792
Today's Dark Arts lessons
had us practicing the Cruciatus Curse.

305
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,878
On first-years.

306
00:32:01,045 --> 00:32:02,880
I refused.

307
00:32:03,673 --> 00:32:05,799
Hogwarts has changed.

308
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:21,148
Let's have a bit of fun, shall we?

309
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:29,197
Hey, listen up, you lot.
Brought you a surprise.

310
00:32:29,365 --> 00:32:33,493
Not more of Aberforth's cooking, I hope.
Be a surprise if we can digest it.

311
00:32:36,331 --> 00:32:37,414
Blimey.

312
00:32:37,582 --> 00:32:39,917
- Harry!
- Yeah!

313
00:32:52,597 --> 00:32:55,432
Get the word out to Remus and the others
that Harry's back.

314
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,768
Okay, let's not kill him before
You-Know-Who...

315
00:32:57,936 --> 00:32:59,478
River, D.A. calling. Do you read?

316
00:32:59,646 --> 00:33:01,563
Lightning has struck.

317
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:04,524
What's the plan, Harry?

318
00:33:09,364 --> 00:33:10,405
Okay.

319
00:33:11,366 --> 00:33:13,492
There's something we need to find.

320
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:18,622
Something hidden here in the castle.
And it may help us defeat You-Know-Who.

321
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:20,582
Right. What is it?

322
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:21,917
We don't know.

323
00:33:23,878 --> 00:33:26,797
- Where is it?
- We don't know that either.

324
00:33:28,174 --> 00:33:31,385
- I realize it's not much to go on.
- That's nothing to go on.

325
00:33:31,552 --> 00:33:34,054
I think it has something to do
with Ravenclaw.

326
00:33:34,222 --> 00:33:38,892
Um, it'll be small, easily concealed.

327
00:33:39,727 --> 00:33:41,895
Anyone, any ideas?

328
00:33:43,231 --> 00:33:45,732
Well, there's Rowena Ravenclaw's
lost diadem.

329
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:49,444
- Oh, bloody hell. Here we go.
- Lost diadem of Ravenclaw?

330
00:33:51,531 --> 00:33:54,950
Hasn't anyone heard of it?
It's quite famous.

331
00:33:55,118 --> 00:33:58,495
Yes, but, Luna, it's lost,
for centuries now.

332
00:33:58,663 --> 00:34:01,456
There isn't a person alive today
who's seen it.

333
00:34:01,624 --> 00:34:03,834
Excuse me. Can someone tell me
what a bloody diadem is?

334
00:34:04,002 --> 00:34:06,753
It's a sort of crown.
You know, like a tiara.

335
00:34:10,008 --> 00:34:11,258
Harry.

336
00:34:12,552 --> 00:34:13,844
Hi there.

337
00:34:17,015 --> 00:34:20,100
Six months she hasn't seen me
and it's like I'm Frankie First-Year.

338
00:34:20,268 --> 00:34:22,019
- I'm her brother.
- Got lots of those.

339
00:34:22,186 --> 00:34:24,479
- There's only one Harry.
- Shut up, Seamus.

340
00:34:24,647 --> 00:34:26,148
What is it, Ginny?

341
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:30,527
Snape knows. He knows that Harry
was spotted in Hogsmeade.

342
00:35:09,776 --> 00:35:15,155
Many of you are surely wondering
why I have summoned you at this hour.

343
00:35:17,617 --> 00:35:21,369
It's come to my attention
that earlier this evening...

344
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:25,082
...Harry Potter was sighted
in Hogsmeade.

345
00:35:27,585 --> 00:35:29,169
Now...

346
00:35:29,337 --> 00:35:30,962
...should anyone...

347
00:35:32,632 --> 00:35:37,844
...student or staff,
attempt to aid Mr. Potter...

348
00:35:39,013 --> 00:35:41,139
...they will be punished...

349
00:35:41,307 --> 00:35:45,769
...in a manner consistent with
the severity of their transgression.

350
00:35:45,937 --> 00:35:48,188
Furthermore...

351
00:35:48,523 --> 00:35:53,193
...any person found to have knowledge
of these events...

352
00:35:54,529 --> 00:35:58,490
...who fails to come forward...

353
00:35:59,408 --> 00:36:03,995
...will be treated as...

354
00:36:04,664 --> 00:36:07,874
...equally guilty.

355
00:36:10,169 --> 00:36:12,003
Now then...

356
00:36:15,466 --> 00:36:17,551
...if anyone here...

357
00:36:18,052 --> 00:36:24,224
...has any knowledge of Mr. Potter's
movements this evening...

358
00:36:26,435 --> 00:36:30,313
...I invite them to step forward...

359
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,569
...now.

360
00:36:50,209 --> 00:36:54,087
It seems, despite your exhaustive
defensive strategies...

361
00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:56,923
...you still have a bit of a
security problem, headmaster.

362
00:37:00,428 --> 00:37:03,430
And I'm afraid it's quite extensive.

363
00:37:04,182 --> 00:37:06,266
How dare you stand where he stood?

364
00:37:07,894 --> 00:37:10,020
Tell them how it happened that night.

365
00:37:10,188 --> 00:37:14,733
Tell them how you looked him in the eye,
a man who trusted you, and killed him.

366
00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:16,776
Tell them.

367
00:37:41,636 --> 00:37:42,636
Coward!

368
00:37:51,729 --> 00:37:54,189
Harry.

369
00:37:55,316 --> 00:37:56,483
Potter?

370
00:38:31,143 --> 00:38:36,690
I know that many of you will want to fight.

371
00:38:36,857 --> 00:38:41,903
Some of you may even think
that to fight is wise.

372
00:38:42,321 --> 00:38:45,365
But this is folly.

373
00:38:45,866 --> 00:38:48,702
Give me Harry Potter.

374
00:38:49,662 --> 00:38:53,832
Do this and none shall be harmed.

375
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:00,046
Give me Harry Potter
and I shall leave Hogwarts untouched.

376
00:39:00,214 --> 00:39:03,133
Give me Harry Potter...

377
00:39:03,301 --> 00:39:07,220
...and you will be rewarded.

378
00:39:07,388 --> 00:39:11,016
You have one hour.

379
00:39:20,735 --> 00:39:22,736
What are you waiting for?

380
00:39:22,903 --> 00:39:24,237
Someone grab him.

381
00:39:33,164 --> 00:39:35,081
Students out of bed.

382
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:38,126
Students out of bed!

383
00:39:38,294 --> 00:39:39,878
Students in the corridor!

384
00:39:40,046 --> 00:39:43,423
They are supposed to be out of bed,
you blithering idiot.

385
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,259
Oh.

386
00:39:46,844 --> 00:39:47,886
Sorry, ma'am.

387
00:39:48,054 --> 00:39:51,931
As it happens, Mr. Filch,
your arrival is most opportune.

388
00:39:52,099 --> 00:39:54,434
If you would, I would like you, please...

389
00:39:54,602 --> 00:39:59,105
...to lead Miss Parkinson and the rest
of Slytherin House from the hall.

390
00:39:59,273 --> 00:40:01,649
Exactly where is it
I'll be leading them to, ma'am?

391
00:40:01,817 --> 00:40:04,611
The dungeons would do.

392
00:40:06,697 --> 00:40:09,407
Right. Come on. Come on.

393
00:40:09,575 --> 00:40:12,869
I presume you have a reason for returning,
Potter. What is it you need?

394
00:40:13,037 --> 00:40:15,622
Time, professor.
As much as you can get me.

395
00:40:16,207 --> 00:40:19,793
Do what you have to do.
I'll secure the castle.

396
00:40:20,628 --> 00:40:22,253
Potter.

397
00:40:24,131 --> 00:40:25,965
It's good to see you.

398
00:40:26,884 --> 00:40:29,219
It's good to see you too, professor.

399
00:40:29,804 --> 00:40:31,930
Hold the fort, Neville.

400
00:40:35,351 --> 00:40:37,352
Hurry up, come on!

401
00:40:44,985 --> 00:40:46,111
Harry. Hermione and I
have been thinking.

402
00:40:46,278 --> 00:40:48,196
It doesn't matter if we find a Horcrux.

403
00:40:48,364 --> 00:40:50,490
- What do you mean?
- Unless we can destroy it.

404
00:40:50,658 --> 00:40:52,033
So we were thinking...

405
00:40:52,201 --> 00:40:54,702
Ron was thinking.
It was Ron's idea. It's brilliant.

406
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:57,997
You destroyed Tom Riddle's diary
with a basilisk fang, right?

407
00:40:58,165 --> 00:41:00,333
Me and Hermione
know where we might find one.

408
00:41:00,501 --> 00:41:02,335
Okay.

409
00:41:02,503 --> 00:41:06,256
Okay, but take this. That way you can
find me when you get back.

410
00:41:06,424 --> 00:41:08,508
- Where are you going?
- Ravenclaw common room.

411
00:41:08,676 --> 00:41:10,176
Gotta start somewhere.

412
00:41:16,267 --> 00:41:18,685
Harry. Harry!

413
00:41:20,771 --> 00:41:23,481
Let me get this straight.
You're giving us permission to do this?

414
00:41:23,649 --> 00:41:25,525
That is correct, Longbottom.

415
00:41:25,693 --> 00:41:27,110
To blow it up? Boom?

416
00:41:27,278 --> 00:41:28,778
Boom!

417
00:41:28,946 --> 00:41:32,365
Wicked. But how on earth
are we gonna do that?

418
00:41:32,533 --> 00:41:34,868
Why don't you confer with Mr. Finnigan?

419
00:41:35,035 --> 00:41:38,580
As I recall, he has a particular proclivity
for pyrotechnics.

420
00:41:38,747 --> 00:41:39,789
I can bring it down.

421
00:41:39,957 --> 00:41:42,333
That's the spirit. Now away you go.

422
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:46,546
You do realize, of course, we can't
keep out You-Know-Who indefinitely.

423
00:41:46,714 --> 00:41:49,883
Well, that doesn't mean
we can't delay him.

424
00:41:50,551 --> 00:41:55,054
And his name is Voldemort, Filius.
You might as well use it.

425
00:41:55,222 --> 00:41:58,141
He's going to try to kill you either way.

426
00:42:00,394 --> 00:42:03,730
Piertotum Locomotor.

427
00:42:19,246 --> 00:42:21,080
Hogwarts is threatened.

428
00:42:21,248 --> 00:42:27,420
Man the boundaries. Protect us.
Do your duty to our school.

429
00:42:30,424 --> 00:42:34,177
I've always wanted to use that spell.

430
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:47,020
Protege Maxima. Fianto Duri.
Repello Inimicum.

431
00:42:55,908 --> 00:42:56,616
Protege Maxima.

432
00:43:25,771 --> 00:43:30,149
- Harry, wait. I need to talk to you.
- I'm a bit preoccupied at the moment, Luna.

433
00:43:30,317 --> 00:43:32,986
You won't find anything
where you're going. You're wasting time.

434
00:43:33,153 --> 00:43:35,154
- Look, we'll talk later, okay, Luna?
- Harry.

435
00:43:35,322 --> 00:43:36,698
- Later.
- Harry Potter!

436
00:43:36,865 --> 00:43:38,825
You listen to me right now!

437
00:43:40,327 --> 00:43:43,371
Don't you remember what Cho said
about Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem?

438
00:43:43,831 --> 00:43:46,791
"There's not a person alive
who's seen it."

439
00:43:46,959 --> 00:43:51,671
It's obvious, isn't it?
We have to talk to someone who's dead.

440
00:44:02,016 --> 00:44:04,851
It's very impressive, isn't it?

441
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,827
If you're to find her,
you'll find her down there.

442
00:44:22,995 --> 00:44:24,412
- Aren't you coming?
- No.

443
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:27,081
I think it's best if you two talk alone.

444
00:44:27,249 --> 00:44:29,459
She's very shy.

445
00:44:55,986 --> 00:44:57,528
You're the Grey Lady...

446
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,073
...the Ghost of Ravenclaw Tower.

447
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,949
I do not answer to that name.

448
00:45:02,117 --> 00:45:06,704
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's Helena, isn't it? Helena Ravenclaw.

449
00:45:06,872 --> 00:45:08,998
Rowena's daughter.

450
00:45:09,166 --> 00:45:11,209
Are you a friend of Luna's?

451
00:45:11,377 --> 00:45:13,294
Yes.

452
00:45:13,462 --> 00:45:15,922
And she thought you might be able
to help me.

453
00:45:17,841 --> 00:45:20,426
You seek my mother's diadem.

454
00:45:21,929 --> 00:45:23,638
Yes.

455
00:45:24,556 --> 00:45:25,598
That's right.

456
00:45:27,351 --> 00:45:32,021
Luna is kind,
unlike so many of the others.

457
00:45:32,189 --> 00:45:35,274
But she was wrong. I cannot help you.

458
00:45:39,905 --> 00:45:42,323
Wait. Please.

459
00:45:44,952 --> 00:45:46,077
I want to destroy it.

460
00:46:24,074 --> 00:46:26,576
They never learn.

461
00:46:27,661 --> 00:46:29,746
Such a pity.

462
00:46:29,997 --> 00:46:33,332
But, my Lord...

463
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,793
...shouldn't we wait for...?

464
00:46:35,961 --> 00:46:37,670
My Lord.

465
00:46:42,843 --> 00:46:44,343
Begin.

466
00:47:04,948 --> 00:47:07,283
That's what you want too,
isn't it, Helena?

467
00:47:12,873 --> 00:47:14,123
You want it destroyed.

468
00:47:14,291 --> 00:47:17,335
Another swore to destroy it
many years ago...

469
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:20,379
...a strange boy with a strange name.

470
00:47:20,547 --> 00:47:23,382
- Tom Riddle.
- But he lied.

471
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:24,717
He's lied to many people.

472
00:47:24,885 --> 00:47:28,012
I know what he's done! I know who he is!

473
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:31,057
He defiled it with dark magic!

474
00:47:46,073 --> 00:47:49,742
I can destroy it once and for all.

475
00:47:51,745 --> 00:47:54,705
But only if you tell me where he hid it.

476
00:47:56,667 --> 00:48:02,421
You do know where he hid it,
don't you, Helena?

477
00:48:03,966 --> 00:48:06,425
You just have to tell me.

478
00:48:07,928 --> 00:48:09,720
Please.

479
00:48:21,441 --> 00:48:23,776
Strange.

480
00:48:26,613 --> 00:48:29,740
You remind me of him a bit.

481
00:48:30,951 --> 00:48:32,201
It's here...

482
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:37,123
...in the castle, in the place where
everything is hidden.

483
00:48:39,334 --> 00:48:40,751
If you have to ask...

484
00:48:40,919 --> 00:48:43,212
...you will never know.

485
00:48:44,214 --> 00:48:47,133
If you know, you need only ask.

486
00:48:49,303 --> 00:48:51,012
Thank you.

487
00:49:03,775 --> 00:49:08,070
Tell Professor McGonagall Remus and I
will handle this side of the castle.

488
00:49:08,906 --> 00:49:10,656
Yes, sir.

489
00:49:14,036 --> 00:49:17,163
Hey, Dean, on second
thoughts, tell Professor McGonagall...

490
00:49:17,331 --> 00:49:20,166
...we might need one or two more wands
this side.

491
00:49:22,669 --> 00:49:25,671
It is the quality of one's
convictions that determines success...

492
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:27,590
...not the number of followers.

493
00:49:27,758 --> 00:49:29,759
Who said that?

494
00:49:30,177 --> 00:49:31,761
Me.

495
00:49:36,516 --> 00:49:38,434
You okay, Freddie?

496
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:40,227
Yeah.

497
00:49:41,688 --> 00:49:43,397
Me too.

498
00:50:00,499 --> 00:50:04,126
Harry talks in his sleep.
Have you noticed?

499
00:50:05,003 --> 00:50:07,046
No, of course not.

500
00:50:54,594 --> 00:50:56,262
Yeah?

501
00:50:56,430 --> 00:50:57,930
You and whose army?

502
00:51:18,118 --> 00:51:19,785
- You do it.
- I can't.

503
00:51:19,953 --> 00:51:22,038
Yes, you can.

504
00:54:20,133 --> 00:54:21,759
Neville!

505
00:54:38,944 --> 00:54:40,694
That went well.

506
00:55:26,992 --> 00:55:31,036
- Get inside!
- This way, everyone. Take cover!

507
00:55:48,722 --> 00:55:50,556
Stupefy!

508
00:55:51,891 --> 00:55:53,392
Get your coat on!

509
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:56,687
Ginny. Neville. Are you all right?

510
00:55:56,855 --> 00:56:01,400
Never better. I feel like I could spit
fire. You haven't seen Luna, have you?

511
00:56:01,568 --> 00:56:03,402
- Luna?
- I'm mad for her!

512
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:07,865
I think it's about time I told her
since we'll probably both be dead by dawn.

513
00:56:11,828 --> 00:56:13,579
I know.

514
00:56:41,399 --> 00:56:43,984
Bloody hell. We'll never find it on this.

515
00:56:44,152 --> 00:56:46,820
- There he is, just there.
- Brilliant.

516
00:56:46,988 --> 00:56:50,282
He just vanished. Just now. I saw it.

517
00:56:53,453 --> 00:56:55,412
Maybe he's gone to
the Room of Requirement.

518
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:59,041
It doesn't show up on the map, does it?
You said that last year.

519
00:56:59,209 --> 00:57:01,543
That's right. I... I did.

520
00:57:01,711 --> 00:57:03,420
Let's go.

521
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:05,839
Brilliant.

522
00:57:11,471 --> 00:57:13,138
Come on!

523
00:59:05,043 --> 00:59:06,376
Well, well.

524
00:59:07,337 --> 00:59:09,421
What brings you here, Potter?

525
00:59:10,256 --> 00:59:12,090
I could ask you the same.

526
00:59:12,717 --> 00:59:14,760
You have something of mine.

527
00:59:15,637 --> 00:59:17,179
I'd like it back.

528
00:59:17,347 --> 00:59:19,723
- What's wrong with the one you have?
It's my mother's.

529
00:59:19,891 --> 00:59:23,769
It's powerful, but it's not the same.

530
00:59:23,937 --> 00:59:27,564
Doesn't quite understand me.

531
00:59:28,066 --> 00:59:29,525
Know what I mean?

532
00:59:30,109 --> 00:59:32,069
Why didn't you tell her?

533
00:59:33,738 --> 00:59:34,947
Bellatrix.

534
00:59:38,326 --> 00:59:41,578
You knew it was me.
You didn't say anything.

535
00:59:43,623 --> 00:59:47,918
Come on, Draco.
Don't be a prat. Do him.

536
00:59:48,711 --> 00:59:50,045
Easy.

537
00:59:51,464 --> 00:59:52,756
Expelliarmus.

538
00:59:52,924 --> 00:59:53,966
Avada Kedavra!

539
00:59:54,133 --> 00:59:55,133
Stupefy!

540
00:59:59,639 --> 01:00:02,641
That's my girlfriend, you numpties!

541
01:00:24,247 --> 01:00:25,872
Got it.

542
01:00:32,672 --> 01:00:34,006
Run!

543
01:00:35,258 --> 01:00:36,466
Run!

544
01:00:40,513 --> 01:00:43,348
Goyle's setting the bloody place on fire!

545
01:01:50,375 --> 01:01:52,250
Come on! This way!

546
01:01:59,592 --> 01:02:01,593
We can't leave them.

547
01:02:01,761 --> 01:02:03,929
He's joking, right?

548
01:02:12,605 --> 01:02:15,440
If we die for them, Harry,
I'm gonna kill you.

549
01:02:38,131 --> 01:02:39,798
Harry!

550
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:27,512
My Lord?

551
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:30,223
Avada Kedavra!

552
01:03:36,564 --> 01:03:40,859
Come, Nagini. I need to keep you safe.

553
01:03:53,206 --> 01:03:55,040
It's the snake.

554
01:03:55,208 --> 01:03:58,835
She's the last one. It's the last Horcrux.

555
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:07,886
Look inside him, Harry.

556
01:04:08,054 --> 01:04:11,848
Find out where he is.
If we find him, we can find the snake.

557
01:04:12,016 --> 01:04:14,142
Then we can end this.

558
01:04:41,838 --> 01:04:43,588
My Lord?

559
01:04:43,756 --> 01:04:47,592
Might it be less, uh...

560
01:04:48,386 --> 01:04:52,681
Might it not be more prudent
to call off this attack...

561
01:04:53,432 --> 01:04:55,767
...and simply seek the boy yourself?

562
01:04:55,935 --> 01:04:59,271
I do not need to seek the boy.

563
01:04:59,438 --> 01:05:03,817
Before the night is out, he will
come to me. Do you understand?

564
01:05:05,778 --> 01:05:07,779
Look at me.

565
01:05:07,947 --> 01:05:11,908
How can you live with yourself, Lucius?

566
01:05:12,076 --> 01:05:13,827
I don't know.

567
01:05:15,955 --> 01:05:18,456
Go and find Severus.

568
01:05:19,083 --> 01:05:21,126
Bring him to me.

569
01:05:29,135 --> 01:05:31,177
I know where he is.

570
01:05:40,855 --> 01:05:42,981
Come on!

571
01:06:23,022 --> 01:06:25,148
Crucio!

572
01:06:30,863 --> 01:06:32,322
No!

573
01:07:18,452 --> 01:07:21,705
You have performed extraordinary
magic with this wand, my Lord...

574
01:07:21,872 --> 01:07:23,915
...in the last few hours alone.

575
01:07:24,083 --> 01:07:25,834
No.

576
01:07:26,293 --> 01:07:29,587
No, I am extraordinary...

577
01:07:29,755 --> 01:07:33,383
...but the wand resists me.

578
01:07:33,551 --> 01:07:36,594
There is no wand more powerful.

579
01:07:36,762 --> 01:07:39,597
Ollivander himself has said it.

580
01:07:39,765 --> 01:07:45,395
Tonight, when the boy comes,
it will not fail you. I am sure of it.

581
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:50,275
It answers to you...

582
01:07:51,110 --> 01:07:53,445
...and you only.

583
01:07:54,196 --> 01:07:55,697
Does it?

584
01:07:58,701 --> 01:08:00,243
My Lord?

585
01:08:02,538 --> 01:08:06,875
The wand, does it truly answer to me?

586
01:08:08,627 --> 01:08:10,754
You're a clever man, Severus.

587
01:08:10,921 --> 01:08:12,797
Surely you must know.

588
01:08:14,508 --> 01:08:18,219
Where does its true loyalty lie?

589
01:08:18,721 --> 01:08:20,472
With you...

590
01:08:20,973 --> 01:08:23,099
...of course, my Lord.

591
01:08:23,267 --> 01:08:24,476
The Elder Wand...

592
01:08:25,269 --> 01:08:31,066
...cannot serve me properly
because I am not its true master.

593
01:08:32,151 --> 01:08:37,655
The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard
who killed its last owner.

594
01:08:43,579 --> 01:08:47,248
You killed Dumbledore, Severus.

595
01:08:48,125 --> 01:08:53,379
While you live,
the Elder Wand cannot truly be mine.

596
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:58,593
You've been a good and faithful servant,
Severus...

597
01:08:59,095 --> 01:09:04,182
...but only I can live forever.

598
01:09:07,478 --> 01:09:08,520
My Lord...

599
01:09:14,527 --> 01:09:16,319
Nagini, kill.

600
01:10:17,423 --> 01:10:19,382
Take them.

601
01:10:20,551 --> 01:10:22,468
Take them.

602
01:10:23,304 --> 01:10:24,762
Please.

603
01:10:24,930 --> 01:10:28,641
Give me something. Quickly.
A flask, anything.

604
01:10:46,952 --> 01:10:48,453
Take them to the Pensieve.

605
01:10:51,999 --> 01:10:53,958
Look at me.

606
01:10:59,715 --> 01:11:02,467
You have your mother's eyes.

607
01:11:36,126 --> 01:11:39,671
You have fought valiantly...

608
01:11:41,090 --> 01:11:43,841
...but in vain.

609
01:11:47,137 --> 01:11:49,389
I do not wish this.

610
01:11:49,556 --> 01:11:55,103
Every drop of magical blood spilled
is a terrible waste.

611
01:11:55,271 --> 01:12:00,024
I therefore command my forces to retreat.

612
01:12:00,192 --> 01:12:05,738
In their absence,
dispose of your dead with dignity.

613
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:12,287
Harry Potter, I now speak directly to you.

614
01:12:12,454 --> 01:12:17,834
On this night, you have allowed
your friends to die for you...

615
01:12:18,002 --> 01:12:20,503
...rather than face me yourself.

616
01:12:20,671 --> 01:12:24,215
There is no greater dishonor.

617
01:12:24,383 --> 01:12:29,387
Join me in the Forbidden Forest
and confront your fate.

618
01:12:30,597 --> 01:12:33,224
If you do not do this...

619
01:12:33,392 --> 01:12:40,064
...I shall kill every last man,
woman and child...

620
01:12:40,232 --> 01:12:44,819
...who tries to conceal you from me.

621
01:13:04,381 --> 01:13:06,299
Where is everybody?

622
01:13:31,116 --> 01:13:32,116
Harry.

623
01:13:37,790 --> 01:13:40,583
- Oh, come on.
- What's the matter with you?

624
01:13:40,751 --> 01:13:42,377
Oh, she's passed.

625
01:13:44,171 --> 01:13:46,672
There, she's gone.

626
01:15:55,427 --> 01:15:56,427
Freak!

627
01:15:56,595 --> 01:15:58,095
Come here.

628
01:15:58,263 --> 01:16:00,348
I'm gonna tell Mummy. You're a freak.

629
01:16:00,516 --> 01:16:02,934
You're a freak, Lily!

630
01:16:03,101 --> 01:16:04,727
Come here.

631
01:16:25,707 --> 01:16:29,001
She's jealous because
she's ordinary and you're special.

632
01:16:29,169 --> 01:16:31,712
That's mean, Severus.

633
01:16:54,528 --> 01:16:56,612
Gryffindor!

634
01:17:04,162 --> 01:17:07,081
- Hi. I'm James.
- Hi. I'm Lily.

635
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:15,798
Just like your father. Lazy. Arrogant.

636
01:17:15,966 --> 01:17:17,800
Don't say a word against my father.

637
01:17:24,099 --> 01:17:25,683
Blood shall be spilt...

638
01:17:25,851 --> 01:17:30,855
...and servant and master
shall be reunited once more.

639
01:17:31,023 --> 01:17:32,940
Severus.

640
01:17:34,026 --> 01:17:36,027
No. Don't kill me.

641
01:17:36,194 --> 01:17:40,031
The prophecy did not refer to a woman.

642
01:17:40,198 --> 01:17:42,450
It spoke of a boy born at the end of July.

643
01:17:42,618 --> 01:17:44,869
Yes, but he thinks it's her son.

644
01:17:45,454 --> 01:17:48,623
He intends to hunt them down now,
to kill them.

645
01:17:48,790 --> 01:17:53,294
Hide her. Hide them all. I beg you.

646
01:17:53,462 --> 01:17:56,547
What will you give me
in exchange, Severus?

647
01:17:58,300 --> 01:17:59,342
Anything.

648
01:17:59,509 --> 01:18:04,221
Harry. Harry, you are so loved. So loved.

649
01:18:05,223 --> 01:18:07,892
Harry, Mama loves you.

650
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:09,935
Dada loves you.

651
01:18:12,022 --> 01:18:14,023
Harry, be safe.

652
01:18:14,191 --> 01:18:15,232
Be strong.

653
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:16,901
Avada Kedavra!

654
01:18:21,406 --> 01:18:25,868
You said you would keep her safe.

655
01:18:26,036 --> 01:18:30,081
Lily and James put
their faith in the wrong person, Severus.

656
01:18:31,041 --> 01:18:33,084
Rather like you.

657
01:18:35,253 --> 01:18:36,712
The boy survives.

658
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:39,131
He doesn't need protection.
The Dark Lord is gone.

659
01:18:39,299 --> 01:18:41,550
The Dark Lord will return.

660
01:18:41,718 --> 01:18:45,262
And when he does,
the boy will be in terrible danger.

661
01:18:46,473 --> 01:18:48,808
He has her eyes.

662
01:18:52,270 --> 01:18:55,439
If you truly loved her...

663
01:18:58,151 --> 01:19:01,987
No one can know.

664
01:19:02,155 --> 01:19:04,657
That I should never reveal
the best of you, Severus?

665
01:19:04,825 --> 01:19:05,866
Your word.

666
01:19:06,034 --> 01:19:08,953
When you risk your life
every day to protect the boy?

667
01:19:09,121 --> 01:19:12,665
He possesses no measurable talent,
his arrogance rivals that of his father...

668
01:19:12,833 --> 01:19:14,709
...and he seems to relish his fame.

669
01:19:14,876 --> 01:19:17,753
Don't say a word against my father.

670
01:19:17,921 --> 01:19:20,131
James Potter?

671
01:19:20,298 --> 01:19:21,799
Lazy, arrogant.

672
01:19:21,967 --> 01:19:23,300
My father was a great man.

673
01:19:23,468 --> 01:19:25,344
Your father was a swine!

674
01:19:27,180 --> 01:19:28,848
Drink the rest.

675
01:19:29,015 --> 01:19:33,060
It will contain the curse to your hand
for the time being.

676
01:19:33,228 --> 01:19:35,146
It will spread, Albus.

677
01:19:35,313 --> 01:19:37,022
How long?

678
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:40,484
Maybe a year.

679
01:19:42,654 --> 01:19:43,821
Don't ignore me, Severus.

680
01:19:43,989 --> 01:19:45,489
Harmonia Nectere Passus.

681
01:19:45,657 --> 01:19:49,660
We both know Lord Voldemort
has ordered the Malfoy boy to murder me.

682
01:19:51,705 --> 01:19:55,958
But should he fail,
one should presume the Dark Lord...

683
01:19:56,126 --> 01:19:58,252
...will turn to you.

684
01:20:01,006 --> 01:20:04,925
You must be the one to kill me, Severus.

685
01:20:05,093 --> 01:20:07,261
It is the only way.

686
01:20:08,221 --> 01:20:12,600
Only then will the Dark Lord
trust you completely.

687
01:20:12,768 --> 01:20:15,436
Avada Kedavra.

688
01:20:18,690 --> 01:20:23,611
There will come a time
when Harry Potter must be told something.

689
01:20:25,197 --> 01:20:30,367
But you must wait until Voldemort
is at his most vulnerable.

690
01:20:30,535 --> 01:20:33,454
Must be told what?

691
01:20:33,622 --> 01:20:35,664
On the night Lord Voldemort...

692
01:20:35,832 --> 01:20:39,043
...went to Godric's Hollow to kill Harry...

693
01:20:40,045 --> 01:20:42,755
...and Lily Potter cast herself
between them...

694
01:20:43,548 --> 01:20:45,466
...the curse rebounded.

695
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:50,888
When that happened,
a part of Voldemort's soul...

696
01:20:51,056 --> 01:20:55,893
...latched itself onto the only
living thing it could find:

697
01:20:56,061 --> 01:20:58,229
Harry himself.

698
01:20:59,564 --> 01:21:02,983
There's a reason Harry can speak
with snakes.

699
01:21:03,568 --> 01:21:06,403
There's a reason he can look into
Lord Voldemort's mind.

700
01:21:08,740 --> 01:21:14,829
A part of Voldemort lives inside him.

701
01:21:21,253 --> 01:21:24,213
So when the time comes...

702
01:21:25,090 --> 01:21:27,258
...the boy must die?

703
01:21:29,177 --> 01:21:31,220
Yes. Yes.

704
01:21:31,388 --> 01:21:33,639
He must die.

705
01:21:51,950 --> 01:21:56,787
You've kept him alive
so that he can die at the proper moment.

706
01:22:00,458 --> 01:22:03,043
You've been raising him
like a pig for slaughter.

707
01:22:05,130 --> 01:22:08,632
Don't tell me now that you've grown
to care for the boy?

708
01:22:13,138 --> 01:22:16,390
Expecto Patronum.

709
01:22:27,319 --> 01:22:28,819
Lily.

710
01:22:32,073 --> 01:22:34,074
After all this time?

711
01:22:37,829 --> 01:22:38,996
Always.

712
01:22:45,128 --> 01:22:48,130
So when the time comes...

713
01:22:48,298 --> 01:22:51,300
...the boy must die?

714
01:22:51,468 --> 01:22:54,845
Yes. He must die.

715
01:22:55,013 --> 01:22:58,015
And Voldemort himself must do it.

716
01:22:58,433 --> 01:23:00,643
That is essential.

717
01:24:05,667 --> 01:24:06,750
Where've you been?

718
01:24:06,918 --> 01:24:10,087
- We thought you went to the forest.
- I'm going there now.

719
01:24:10,255 --> 01:24:13,215
Are you mad? No.

720
01:24:13,925 --> 01:24:16,427
You can't give yourself up to him.

721
01:24:19,764 --> 01:24:21,682
What is it, Harry?

722
01:24:23,226 --> 01:24:25,144
What is it you know?

723
01:24:27,939 --> 01:24:30,524
There's a reason I can hear them...

724
01:24:31,109 --> 01:24:32,359
...the Horcruxes.

725
01:24:34,863 --> 01:24:37,239
I think I've known for a while.

726
01:24:38,658 --> 01:24:40,951
And I think you have too.

727
01:24:43,913 --> 01:24:47,082
- I'll go with you.
- No, kill the snake.

728
01:24:47,792 --> 01:24:49,960
Kill the snake and then it's just him.

729
01:26:10,166 --> 01:26:12,209
I'm ready to die.

730
01:26:53,501 --> 01:26:55,919
The Resurrection Stone.

731
01:27:25,617 --> 01:27:28,994
You've been so brave, sweetheart.

732
01:27:33,082 --> 01:27:34,958
Why are you here?

733
01:27:35,752 --> 01:27:37,544
All of you?

734
01:27:39,923 --> 01:27:42,090
We never left.

735
01:27:50,975 --> 01:27:52,559
Does it...?

736
01:27:53,311 --> 01:27:54,478
Does it hurt?

737
01:27:55,521 --> 01:27:57,231
Dying?

738
01:27:58,149 --> 01:28:00,692
Quicker than falling asleep.

739
01:28:04,614 --> 01:28:06,907
You're nearly there, son.

740
01:28:07,075 --> 01:28:08,283
I'm sorry.

741
01:28:08,451 --> 01:28:11,954
I never wanted any of you to die for me.

742
01:28:13,539 --> 01:28:15,165
And, Remus, your son...

743
01:28:15,333 --> 01:28:19,586
Others will tell him
what his mother and father died for.

744
01:28:19,754 --> 01:28:23,215
One day, he'll understand.

745
01:28:34,978 --> 01:28:36,520
You'll stay with me?

746
01:28:38,064 --> 01:28:40,357
Until the end.

747
01:28:41,025 --> 01:28:43,026
And he won't be able to see you?

748
01:28:43,194 --> 01:28:44,861
No.

749
01:28:46,155 --> 01:28:48,740
We're here, you see.

750
01:29:03,298 --> 01:29:05,340
Stay close to me.

751
01:29:07,051 --> 01:29:09,219
Always.

752
01:29:23,985 --> 01:29:27,738
No sign of him, my Lord.

753
01:29:43,171 --> 01:29:45,922
I thought he would come.

754
01:30:26,798 --> 01:30:30,467
Harry? No! What are you doing here?

755
01:30:30,635 --> 01:30:31,927
Quiet!

756
01:30:42,939 --> 01:30:45,190
Harry Potter.

757
01:30:48,319 --> 01:30:50,987
The Boy Who Lived.

758
01:30:55,243 --> 01:30:57,661
Come to die.

759
01:31:15,888 --> 01:31:17,597
Avada Kedavra!

760
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:16,656
You can't help. Harry...

761
01:32:18,743 --> 01:32:20,535
...you wonderful boy.

762
01:32:21,037 --> 01:32:24,915
You brave, brave man.

763
01:32:26,918 --> 01:32:28,877
Let us walk.

764
01:32:36,344 --> 01:32:38,595
Professor, what is that?

765
01:32:41,265 --> 01:32:44,309
Something beyond either of our help.

766
01:32:47,188 --> 01:32:50,440
A part of Voldemort sent here to die.

767
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:52,025
And exactly where are we?

768
01:32:53,277 --> 01:32:57,280
I was going to ask you that.
Where would you say that we are?

769
01:32:57,448 --> 01:32:59,157
Well...

770
01:32:59,325 --> 01:33:01,952
...it looks like King's Cross station.

771
01:33:02,286 --> 01:33:04,621
Only cleaner.

772
01:33:04,789 --> 01:33:06,998
And without all the trains.

773
01:33:07,542 --> 01:33:10,293
King's Cross, is that right?

774
01:33:10,628 --> 01:33:14,214
This is, as they say, your party.

775
01:33:15,383 --> 01:33:18,385
I expect you now realize
that you and Voldemort...

776
01:33:18,553 --> 01:33:21,388
...have been connected by something
other than fate...

777
01:33:21,556 --> 01:33:24,599
...since that night in Godric's Hollow
all those years ago.

778
01:33:24,767 --> 01:33:26,476
So it's true then, sir?

779
01:33:26,644 --> 01:33:29,646
A part of him lives within me, doesn't it?

780
01:33:29,981 --> 01:33:30,981
Did.

781
01:33:31,148 --> 01:33:35,986
It was just destroyed many moments ago
by none other than Voldemort himself.

782
01:33:37,029 --> 01:33:41,741
You were the Horcrux
he never meant to make, Harry.

783
01:33:54,297 --> 01:33:55,839
I have to go back, haven't I?

784
01:33:56,007 --> 01:33:57,882
Oh. That's up to you.

785
01:33:58,050 --> 01:33:59,843
I have a choice?

786
01:34:00,011 --> 01:34:01,803
Oh, yes.

787
01:34:01,971 --> 01:34:04,806
We're in King's Cross, you say?

788
01:34:05,891 --> 01:34:10,687
I think, if you so desired,
you'd be able to board a train.

789
01:34:12,106 --> 01:34:13,440
And where would it take me?

790
01:34:15,026 --> 01:34:16,860
On.

791
01:34:34,837 --> 01:34:36,921
Voldemort has the Elder Wand.

792
01:34:39,550 --> 01:34:40,592
True.

793
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:43,553
- And the snake's still alive.
- Yes.

794
01:34:43,721 --> 01:34:46,306
And I've nothing to kill it with.

795
01:34:46,849 --> 01:34:51,561
Help will always be given at Hogwarts,
Harry, to those who ask for it.

796
01:34:52,772 --> 01:34:56,483
I've always prized myself
on my ability to turn a phrase.

797
01:34:57,401 --> 01:35:00,570
Words are,
in my not so humble opinion...

798
01:35:00,738 --> 01:35:04,324
...our most inexhaustible
source of magic...

799
01:35:04,492 --> 01:35:08,828
...capable of both inflicting injury
and remedying it.

800
01:35:09,455 --> 01:35:15,377
But I would, in this case,
amend my original statement to this:

801
01:35:18,172 --> 01:35:24,344
Help will always be given at Hogwarts
to those who deserve it.

802
01:35:30,184 --> 01:35:32,936
Do not pity the dead, Harry.

803
01:35:33,396 --> 01:35:35,438
Pity the living.

804
01:35:35,981 --> 01:35:40,860
And, above all,
all those who live without love.

805
01:35:41,821 --> 01:35:47,242
Professor, my mother's Patronus
was a doe, wasn't it?

806
01:35:48,285 --> 01:35:50,912
That's the same as Professor Snape's.

807
01:35:51,789 --> 01:35:53,873
It's curious, don't you think?

808
01:35:54,041 --> 01:35:59,003
Actually, if I think about it,
it doesn't seem curious at all.

809
01:36:00,715 --> 01:36:02,882
I'll be going now, Harry.

810
01:36:03,426 --> 01:36:04,759
Professor?

811
01:36:09,265 --> 01:36:11,433
Is this all real?

812
01:36:12,101 --> 01:36:13,935
Or is it just happening inside my head?

813
01:36:14,103 --> 01:36:17,647
Of course it's happening inside
your head, Harry.

814
01:36:17,815 --> 01:36:21,568
Why should that mean that it's not real?

815
01:36:27,158 --> 01:36:29,784
Professor? What should I do?

816
01:36:34,498 --> 01:36:36,291
Professor?

817
01:36:39,670 --> 01:36:40,962
My Lord?

818
01:36:41,130 --> 01:36:43,256
My Lord, are you hurt? My Lord?

819
01:36:43,424 --> 01:36:45,049
I don't need your help.

820
01:36:45,217 --> 01:36:47,927
No. Come.

821
01:36:56,645 --> 01:36:58,480
The boy.

822
01:36:58,647 --> 01:37:00,565
Is he dead?

823
01:37:14,663 --> 01:37:16,873
Is he alive?

824
01:37:17,041 --> 01:37:19,209
Draco, is he alive?

825
01:37:45,903 --> 01:37:47,403
Dead.

826
01:39:14,575 --> 01:39:17,201
Who is that Hagrid's carrying?

827
01:39:17,870 --> 01:39:19,704
Neville, who is it?

828
01:39:20,372 --> 01:39:22,874
Harry Potter...

829
01:39:24,001 --> 01:39:25,501
...is dead.

830
01:39:25,669 --> 01:39:27,253
No! No!

831
01:39:27,421 --> 01:39:28,796
Silence.

832
01:39:32,468 --> 01:39:33,509
Stupid girl.

833
01:39:35,721 --> 01:39:39,182
Harry Potter is dead.

834
01:39:39,350 --> 01:39:44,479
From this day forth, you put your faith...

835
01:39:44,647 --> 01:39:45,688
...in me.

836
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:58,534
Harry Potter is dead!

837
01:40:03,374 --> 01:40:06,834
And now is the time to declare yourself.

838
01:40:08,379 --> 01:40:11,130
Come forward and join us.

839
01:40:13,050 --> 01:40:14,759
Or die.

840
01:40:20,307 --> 01:40:21,349
Draco.

841
01:40:27,022 --> 01:40:28,898
Draco.

842
01:40:31,777 --> 01:40:33,695
Draco...

843
01:40:36,532 --> 01:40:38,408
...come.

844
01:40:49,420 --> 01:40:52,839
Ah. Well done, Draco.

845
01:40:53,632 --> 01:40:55,508
Well done.

846
01:41:18,073 --> 01:41:20,825
Well, I must say I'd hoped for better.

847
01:41:25,247 --> 01:41:28,124
And who might you be, young man?

848
01:41:29,418 --> 01:41:31,335
Neville Longbottom.

849
01:41:36,633 --> 01:41:40,344
Well, Neville, I'm sure we can
find a place for you in our ranks.

850
01:41:40,512 --> 01:41:42,764
I'd like to say something.

851
01:41:48,896 --> 01:41:54,650
Well, Neville, I'm sure we'd all be
fascinated to hear what you have to say.

852
01:41:57,654 --> 01:42:00,156
- It doesn't matter Harry's gone.
- Stand down, Neville.

853
01:42:00,324 --> 01:42:02,950
People die every day.

854
01:42:04,620 --> 01:42:08,664
Friends, family.

855
01:42:10,709 --> 01:42:12,293
Yeah.

856
01:42:13,712 --> 01:42:15,880
We lost Harry tonight.

857
01:42:17,424 --> 01:42:21,928
But he's still with us, in here.

858
01:42:22,930 --> 01:42:24,847
So's Fred...

859
01:42:25,849 --> 01:42:27,642
...and Remus.

860
01:42:28,727 --> 01:42:30,061
Tonks.

861
01:42:31,396 --> 01:42:33,314
All of them.

862
01:42:34,483 --> 01:42:36,734
They didn't die in vain.

863
01:42:41,865 --> 01:42:42,949
But you will.

864
01:42:43,117 --> 01:42:45,493
- Because you're wrong.
- Ha-ha-ha.

865
01:42:45,661 --> 01:42:48,454
Harry's heart did beat for us.
For all of us. This is not over!

866
01:42:54,545 --> 01:42:56,379
Confringo!

867
01:43:04,680 --> 01:43:06,222
No! No, come back!

868
01:43:06,390 --> 01:43:10,351
Lucius! Come back! Come back and fight!

869
01:43:10,519 --> 01:43:12,562
Come back!

870
01:43:17,609 --> 01:43:20,778
I'll lure him into the castle.
We have to kill the snake.

871
01:43:20,946 --> 01:43:22,864
- You'll need this.
- Neville!

872
01:46:16,413 --> 01:46:18,914
Not my daughter, you bitch.

873
01:46:52,407 --> 01:46:53,741
You were right...

874
01:46:55,494 --> 01:46:57,828
...when you told Snape
that wand was failing you.

875
01:46:57,996 --> 01:46:59,663
It will always fail you.

876
01:47:00,957 --> 01:47:02,541
I killed Snape.

877
01:47:02,709 --> 01:47:04,835
But what if the wand
never belonged to Snape?

878
01:47:05,003 --> 01:47:07,880
What if its allegiance was always
to someone else?

879
01:47:08,048 --> 01:47:11,258
Come on, Tom.
Let's finish this the way we started it.

880
01:47:11,718 --> 01:47:12,760
Together.

881
01:50:47,225 --> 01:50:49,226
- Ha, ha.
- I always figured he would be a big fellow.

882
01:50:49,394 --> 01:50:53,731
I couldn't find my wand.
I haven't lost my wand in my entire life.

883
01:50:53,898 --> 01:50:55,899
It was lost in the folds of my gowns.

884
01:50:56,067 --> 01:50:58,861
I managed to find it
and I dispatched a few of them...

885
01:50:59,029 --> 01:51:00,279
Harry.

886
01:52:00,757 --> 01:52:04,426
Why didn't it work for him,
the Elder Wand?

887
01:52:05,428 --> 01:52:07,346
It answered to somebody else.

888
01:52:08,306 --> 01:52:11,100
When he killed Snape,
he thought the wand would become his.

889
01:52:11,267 --> 01:52:15,437
But the thing is,
the wand never belonged to Snape.

890
01:52:15,605 --> 01:52:20,109
It was Draco who disarmed Dumbledore
that night in the astronomy tower.

891
01:52:20,276 --> 01:52:24,279
From that moment on,
the wand answered to him.

892
01:52:25,156 --> 01:52:26,990
Until...

893
01:52:27,158 --> 01:52:31,745
...the other night
when I disarmed Draco at Malfoy Manor.

894
01:52:31,913 --> 01:52:34,039
So that means...

895
01:52:35,583 --> 01:52:37,334
It's mine.

896
01:52:39,295 --> 01:52:40,795
What should we do with it?

897
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:42,965
We?

898
01:52:43,341 --> 01:52:47,594
I'm just saying, that's the Elder Wand,
the most powerful wand in the world.

899
01:52:47,762 --> 01:52:51,682
With that, we'd be invincible.

900
01:55:14,826 --> 01:55:16,493
Together.

901
01:55:33,803 --> 01:55:35,971
Look after each other.

902
01:55:55,158 --> 01:55:56,950
- Bag?
- Yeah.

903
01:55:57,118 --> 01:55:58,160
Jumper?

904
01:55:59,829 --> 01:56:01,830
I'll miss you.

905
01:56:02,957 --> 01:56:04,666
Here they come.

906
01:56:19,849 --> 01:56:24,061
Dad, what if I am put in Slytherin?

907
01:56:26,356 --> 01:56:28,899
Albus Severus Potter...

908
01:56:30,193 --> 01:56:33,904
...you were named after two headmasters
of Hogwarts.

909
01:56:34,072 --> 01:56:35,697
One of them was a Slytherin...

910
01:56:35,865 --> 01:56:39,076
...and he was the bravest man
I've ever known.

911
01:56:40,954 --> 01:56:42,204
But just say that I am.

912
01:56:42,372 --> 01:56:48,001
Then Slytherin House will have gained
a wonderful young wizard.

913
01:56:48,169 --> 01:56:53,882
But, listen, if it really means that much
to you, you can choose Gryffindor.

914
01:56:54,050 --> 01:56:56,969
The Sorting Hat
takes your choice into account.

915
01:56:57,553 --> 01:56:59,596
- Really?
- Really.

916
01:57:00,974 --> 01:57:03,642
- Bye, Mum.
- All aboard.

917
01:57:03,810 --> 01:57:04,851
Ready?

918
01:57:05,019 --> 01:57:06,561
Ready.

919
01:57:18,825 --> 01:57:20,450
Come on, Jay, get a move on.

920
01:57:20,618 --> 01:57:22,077
Come on.
