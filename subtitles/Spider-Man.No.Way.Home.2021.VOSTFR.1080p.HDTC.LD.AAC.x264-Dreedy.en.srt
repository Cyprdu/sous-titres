00:00:01,164 --> 00:00:03,224
We come to you now with
revelations about last week's attack

2
00:00:03,244 --> 00:00:05,804
in London. An anonymous
source provided this video.

3
00:00:06,156 --> 00:00:10,506
It shows Quentin Beck, aka
Mysterio, moments before his death.

4
00:00:10,953 --> 00:00:13,483
A warning, you may
find this video disturbing.

5
00:00:13,623 --> 00:00:15,653
I managed to send the
Elemental back through the dimensional rift but I

6
00:00:15,673 --> 00:00:17,519
don't think I'm gonna make
it out of this bridge alive.

7
00:00:17,543 --> 00:00:19,373
Spider-Man attacked me
for some reason. He has

8
00:00:19,393 --> 00:00:21,233
an army of weaponized
drones, Stark technology.

9
00:00:21,253 --> 00:00:24,753
He's saying he's the only one who's
gonna be the new Iron Man, no one else.

10
00:00:25,523 --> 00:00:27,633
Are you sure you want
to commence the drone attack?

11
00:00:27,663 --> 00:00:29,423
There will be
significant casualties.

12
00:00:29,573 --> 00:00:32,103
Do it. Execute them all.

13
00:00:35,883 --> 00:00:38,843
This shocking video
was released earlier today

14
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:41,973
on the controversial news
website TheDailyBugle.net.

15
00:00:42,123 --> 00:00:46,123
There you have it, folks, conclusive
proof that Spider-Man was responsible

16
00:00:46,153 --> 00:00:49,533
for the brutal murder of Mysterio,
an interdimensional warrior

17
00:00:49,553 --> 00:00:52,843
who gave his life to protect
our planet, and who will no doubt

18
00:00:52,873 --> 00:00:57,263
go down in history as the
greatest superhero of all time.

19
00:00:57,943 --> 00:00:59,983
But that's not all, folks.

20
00:01:00,013 --> 00:01:03,023
Here's the real blockbuster. Brace
yourselves, you might wanna sit down.

21
00:01:03,053 --> 00:01:05,733
Spider-Man's real...
Spider-Man's real name is...

22
00:01:07,873 --> 00:01:10,633
Spider-Man's name is Peter Parker.

23
00:01:11,103 --> 00:01:13,373
What the f...

24
00:01:13,603 --> 00:01:18,003
That's right, folks. Peter Parker,
a seventeen year old high school

25
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:20,193
delinquent,
harboring a homicidal...

26
00:01:20,483 --> 00:01:24,093
Are you Spider-Man's girlfriend?
Are you Spider-Man's girlfriend?

27
00:01:24,753 --> 00:01:27,653
- Spider-Man!
- He's here!

28
00:01:27,723 --> 00:01:30,243
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Please don't touch her.
- You're just a kid?

29
00:01:30,543 --> 00:01:33,453
You murdered Mysterio? You
helped him murder Mysterio?

30
00:01:33,503 --> 00:01:35,133
No, I... I didn't...

31
00:01:35,163 --> 00:01:36,433
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

32
00:01:36,453 --> 00:01:38,113
He hit me. Spider-Man hit me!

33
00:01:38,193 --> 00:01:40,093
He hit me. Spider-Man hit me!

34
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:42,343
People looked up to this
boy and called him a hero.

35
00:01:42,373 --> 00:01:45,993
I'll tell you what I call him:
Public Enemy Number One!

36
00:01:46,253 --> 00:01:48,883
I don't ever wanna
do this ever again!

37
00:01:49,203 --> 00:01:52,003
MJ, I'm so sorry but I can't see
anything with your hand in my...

38
00:01:52,093 --> 00:01:53,699
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Okay,
where are we gonna go?

39
00:01:53,723 --> 00:01:56,263
- I don't know. Your house.
- Oh, no! We can't go to my house.

40
00:01:56,303 --> 00:01:57,693
- My Dad will kill you!
- What?

41
00:01:57,713 --> 00:01:59,363
I thought you said your
Dad really liked me?

42
00:01:59,383 --> 00:02:00,903
Yeah, well, not anymore.

43
00:02:03,363 --> 00:02:04,573
- Dude.
- Dude!

44
00:02:04,593 --> 00:02:05,993
- Dude.
- Dude!

45
00:02:06,013 --> 00:02:08,133
- Dude.
- Dude!

46
00:02:08,203 --> 00:02:11,703
- Dude!
- What... I'm so sorry!

47
00:02:11,713 --> 00:02:13,493
- Are you okay?
- No, not really.

48
00:02:13,713 --> 00:02:14,903
Yo, Peter!

49
00:02:22,513 --> 00:02:24,303
We should go. We
should go. Come on.

50
00:02:24,343 --> 00:02:26,653
- But you said you don't wanna swing...
- You should just swing me. Yeah.

51
00:02:26,673 --> 00:02:28,263
Okay. We can take the subway.

52
00:02:39,343 --> 00:02:40,663
Look out!

53
00:02:48,933 --> 00:02:51,013
That was so much worse. Okay.

54
00:02:51,223 --> 00:02:53,793
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah...

55
00:02:54,623 --> 00:02:58,123
Come on, come on, come
on. Okay. I'm so sorry.

56
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:16,143
I just feel so dumb. I didn't
realize you were miserable.

57
00:03:16,253 --> 00:03:19,403
No, it was really fun, alright? You
know, that's why they call it a fling!

58
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,403
- And we flung.
- It was fun.

59
00:03:21,453 --> 00:03:23,423
I could've been
more fun. I can be fun.

60
00:03:23,493 --> 00:03:26,163
- We'll hang out again.
- Like... when do you think?

61
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,593
- I should see what that is.
- No. No, no, no, no. Happy.

62
00:03:31,623 --> 00:03:33,193
- It's what I do.
- He's always coming and going...

63
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,213
- Peter?
- It's not...

64
00:03:34,383 --> 00:03:37,253
- Peter? Oh. God. Peter...
- Oh, no. Oh, no. I don't know what to do!

65
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,343
Peter...

66
00:03:39,593 --> 00:03:41,113
- Oh. Oh, no.
- We didn't see anything.

67
00:03:41,303 --> 00:03:43,099
- This isn't what it looks like, Happy.
- I'm sorry...

68
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:44,359
- Just practice safe...
- It's not what it looks like.

69
00:03:44,383 --> 00:03:45,883
Oh, hey!

70
00:03:45,913 --> 00:03:47,503
You must be MJ!

71
00:03:47,683 --> 00:03:49,733
- Nice to meet you.
- So nice to meet you.

72
00:03:49,753 --> 00:03:51,813
Wait, have you been crying?

73
00:03:51,843 --> 00:03:53,023
We broke up.

74
00:03:54,623 --> 00:03:57,513
- Hey, Spider-Man!
- Oh, uh...

75
00:03:57,573 --> 00:04:01,073
Thank you. I didn't know you guys
broke up. I thought you were in love, May.

76
00:04:01,103 --> 00:04:04,523
- No, we talked about this...
- I should probably leave, I think...

77
00:04:04,553 --> 00:04:06,369
I thought you guys were
such a handsome couple...

78
00:04:06,393 --> 00:04:08,693
- You know, it's really about boundaries...
- Oh...

79
00:04:09,153 --> 00:04:11,283
- Oh, hey, listen. Go in here.
- Is that the door?

80
00:04:11,303 --> 00:04:14,143
- Hey, is it true about...
- Not now!

81
00:04:14,663 --> 00:04:15,703
Just make yourself home...

82
00:04:15,913 --> 00:04:17,453
about sex, Peter.

83
00:04:17,513 --> 00:04:18,573
This has nothing to do with sex.

84
00:04:18,593 --> 00:04:20,739
God's sakes, it's the goal but
if you wanna go over it again...

85
00:04:20,763 --> 00:04:22,253
I mean, I'm...
What's that sound?

86
00:04:24,293 --> 00:04:25,833
Hey, Spider-Man!

87
00:04:27,093 --> 00:04:29,963
I mean, I'm happy to rehash
it if you want to. I just don't...

88
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:37,993
Can you get off your
phones for like, five minutes,

89
00:04:38,023 --> 00:04:40,453
I just wanna talk to you
about your relationship, okay?

90
00:04:40,483 --> 00:04:41,493
Peter?

91
00:04:44,773 --> 00:04:45,783
What?

92
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,813
- Is that...
- Is that here?

93
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:08,183
I mean maybe it's
not such a big deal.

94
00:05:08,243 --> 00:05:09,493
Spider-Menace!

95
00:05:10,203 --> 00:05:12,603
Governments around the
world launched investigations

96
00:05:12,633 --> 00:05:15,133
into the murderer
known as Spider-Man,

97
00:05:15,313 --> 00:05:20,213
aka, Peter Parker, aka, the
web-headed war criminal,

98
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:24,233
who for years has been terrorizing
the decent citizens of New York.

99
00:05:24,313 --> 00:05:27,953
Well now, this city and the
world see him for what he truly is.

100
00:05:28,063 --> 00:05:29,203
Murderer!

101
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:33,993
New details from last week's
devastating attack in London have emerged.

102
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,093
For more, we go now to
Joint Intelligence Headquarters...

103
00:05:37,143 --> 00:05:39,523
who released just a
short while ago confirms,

104
00:05:39,553 --> 00:05:42,053
that the deadly drones
used in the London attack,

105
00:05:42,073 --> 00:05:44,473
were designed by Stark Industries.

106
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:48,273
- Federal agents! Open up!
- Federal agents? You stay here!

107
00:05:49,613 --> 00:05:51,253
Department of Damage Control.

108
00:05:51,283 --> 00:05:52,963
We have a warrant for
the arrest of Peter Parker.

109
00:05:52,973 --> 00:05:54,303
- You know the fourth amendment?
- Sure.

110
00:05:54,323 --> 00:05:57,043
- Unreasonable search and seizure?
- Get in here, guys. Let's go.

111
00:05:58,613 --> 00:06:02,163
- I didn't kill Quentin Beck. The drones did.
- The drones that are yours.

112
00:06:02,213 --> 00:06:03,583
No... Well, look...

113
00:06:03,603 --> 00:06:07,083
Nick Fury was there the entire time.
Just ask him and he can explain everything.

114
00:06:07,173 --> 00:06:09,723
Nick Fury has been
off-planet for the last year.

115
00:06:09,823 --> 00:06:10,833
What?

116
00:06:11,073 --> 00:06:12,083
Peter!

117
00:06:12,563 --> 00:06:13,573
MJ! Uhh...

118
00:06:13,953 --> 00:06:15,349
They had nothing
to do with it, sir!

119
00:06:15,373 --> 00:06:17,749
- Don't say anything without a lawyer!
- Don't say anything without a lawyer!

120
00:06:17,773 --> 00:06:18,963
I want a lawyer.

121
00:06:19,603 --> 00:06:20,643
Miss Jones-Watson...

122
00:06:20,673 --> 00:06:22,103
Jones. I don't go by Watson.

123
00:06:22,453 --> 00:06:23,463
Miss Jones...

124
00:06:23,623 --> 00:06:25,904
- Why do you want a lawyer if...
- I have nothing to hide?

125
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:28,933
- Exactly. Unless...
- I'm actually guilty of something?

126
00:06:29,123 --> 00:06:31,673
I'm very aware of your
tactics and my rights.

127
00:06:32,423 --> 00:06:33,823
Just answer my questions.

128
00:06:34,483 --> 00:06:35,753
I've seen your file.

129
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:39,273
You're a smart, young woman
with a bright future ahead of her.

130
00:06:39,613 --> 00:06:43,793
Why would you risk it all by getting
involved with a vigilante like Peter Parker?

131
00:06:45,323 --> 00:06:47,583
So sorry to keep you waiting.

132
00:06:47,633 --> 00:06:50,163
Can we get Ned a snack,
please? He's been waiting.

133
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:52,543
Dude, I'm so sorry about that.

134
00:06:52,733 --> 00:06:54,169
I'm not supposed to
say anything to you.

135
00:06:54,193 --> 00:06:55,493
No, Ned. Not even a thing.

136
00:06:55,513 --> 00:06:56,863
I just have one question...

137
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,373
When MJ told you that
Peter was Spider-Man...

138
00:06:59,403 --> 00:07:01,403
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...
- What's up?

139
00:07:01,443 --> 00:07:04,343
I knew way before MJ did. I
was Spider-Man's guy in the chair.

140
00:07:04,403 --> 00:07:05,423
Oh, I know about those.

141
00:07:05,443 --> 00:07:06,933
I mean, half the guys
have guys in the chair.

142
00:07:06,953 --> 00:07:08,643
Exactly! You wouldn't know...

143
00:07:08,693 --> 00:07:10,983
I literally helped
him find the Vulture.

144
00:07:10,993 --> 00:07:12,113
I didn't know that.

145
00:07:12,143 --> 00:07:15,493
And I helped him hack his suit once,
and kinda helped him get to Space.

146
00:07:15,513 --> 00:07:19,243
So, in Spider-Man's illegal vigilantism,
you were his main accomplice.

147
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:25,483
I would like to have my
words stricken from the record.

148
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:26,793
With all due respect,

149
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:29,163
and I mean that
very insincerely,

150
00:07:29,183 --> 00:07:32,223
unless you have some real
specific charges to throw at us,

151
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,393
legally, you can't hold us here.

152
00:07:34,973 --> 00:07:36,513
You should definitely lawyer up.

153
00:07:36,533 --> 00:07:37,543
Excuse me?

154
00:07:37,633 --> 00:07:39,983
Child endangerment is a nasty rap.

155
00:07:40,383 --> 00:07:44,003
The boy was entrusted to you, and as
his legal guardian, essentially his mother,

156
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:48,303
you not only allowed him to endanger
himself, but you actually encouraged it.

157
00:07:48,373 --> 00:07:49,683
Who does that?

158
00:07:49,823 --> 00:07:51,853
I wanna see Peter right now.

159
00:07:52,213 --> 00:07:57,443
Stark Industries was caught in the web of
the Spider-Man/Mysterio controversy today,

160
00:07:57,483 --> 00:08:02,493
when federal agents opened an investigation
into missing Stark technology.

161
00:08:02,543 --> 00:08:04,853
The agents wanna know
exactly what was taken...

162
00:08:05,023 --> 00:08:06,973
At least they used
a good picture.

163
00:08:11,433 --> 00:08:13,493
That's great. Thank you.

164
00:08:13,723 --> 00:08:15,603
Well, I have some
good news, Peter.

165
00:08:15,673 --> 00:08:18,153
I don't believe any of the
charges against you are gonna stick.

166
00:08:18,223 --> 00:08:20,843
- Wait, seriously?
- Oh, I knew it.

167
00:08:20,873 --> 00:08:22,359
- Oh, my God, Mr. Murdock. Thank you.
- Yes.

168
00:08:22,383 --> 00:08:24,063
- Thank you, Matt.
- That's amazing.

169
00:08:24,273 --> 00:08:25,993
Well, perfect. However...

170
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:27,403
- Mister Hogan?
- Yes?

171
00:08:27,483 --> 00:08:30,073
The feds are actively
investigating the missing technology.

172
00:08:30,653 --> 00:08:34,253
I understand you're loyal to Mr. Stark
and his legacy, but if you were involved...

173
00:08:34,433 --> 00:08:36,403
- If I was involved?
- I might secure a lawyer.

174
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:39,153
I need a lawyer because I'm
un... I'm under inves... I thought,

175
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:41,433
you said, there's no
charge. I could say

176
00:08:41,493 --> 00:08:44,653
under advisement of counsel,
I refuse to answer the question

177
00:08:44,673 --> 00:08:46,954
respectfully because I... the
answer could incriminate me.

178
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:49,329
There's a saying in Goodfellas.
What did they say in Goodfellas?

179
00:08:49,353 --> 00:08:50,913
I know, that's
interesting... Calm down.

180
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,763
Let's hear what
he has to say. Matt?

181
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:54,513
You're gonna need
a really good lawyer.

182
00:08:55,773 --> 00:08:58,893
Peter, you may have dodged your legal
troubles, but things will get much worse.

183
00:08:59,173 --> 00:09:01,243
There is still the
court of public opinion.

184
00:09:08,603 --> 00:09:10,263
How did you just do that?

185
00:09:10,703 --> 00:09:12,453
I'm a really good lawyer.

186
00:09:13,813 --> 00:09:16,103
We're gonna need
a safer place to live.

187
00:09:30,763 --> 00:09:32,613
Alarm systems, deactivated.

188
00:09:35,043 --> 00:09:38,113
It looks nice and... safe.

189
00:09:41,153 --> 00:09:44,513
Welcome, to the spiritual oasis.

190
00:09:44,953 --> 00:09:46,703
You like Donkey Kong Jr.?

191
00:10:03,543 --> 00:10:05,103
Oh, Happy.

192
00:10:05,513 --> 00:10:07,313
Did you send in your applications yet?

193
00:10:07,323 --> 00:10:10,233
I literally just finished
my MIT one. You?

194
00:10:10,263 --> 00:10:11,863
- Same.
- Imagine if we both got in?

195
00:10:11,873 --> 00:10:13,463
- And Ned?
- Yeah, but...

196
00:10:13,693 --> 00:10:16,293
We have to take scholarships
so we could actually go.

197
00:10:16,423 --> 00:10:18,633
Come on. You got good
scores, and good grades, and...

198
00:10:18,643 --> 00:10:21,863
- You think I'm being too pragmatic.
- No, no, no, no. Well...

199
00:10:22,813 --> 00:10:24,063
Kind of. That's okay.

200
00:10:24,133 --> 00:10:25,419
That's one of my
favorite things about you.

201
00:10:25,443 --> 00:10:26,593
- Really?
- Yeah.

202
00:10:26,953 --> 00:10:28,673
Well, what are your
other favorite things?

203
00:10:28,693 --> 00:10:30,353
I love your relentless optimism.

204
00:10:30,393 --> 00:10:32,943
Yeah. I am a "glass
half full" kind of gal.

205
00:10:32,983 --> 00:10:34,643
I really like how
you're a people person.

206
00:10:34,663 --> 00:10:35,833
I love people.

207
00:10:35,883 --> 00:10:37,313
Love 'em... so much.

208
00:10:37,363 --> 00:10:38,273
You like sports.

209
00:10:38,293 --> 00:10:40,473
I think the Mets are gonna
go all the way this year.

210
00:10:40,493 --> 00:10:42,633
- Really?
- What's that noise?

211
00:10:42,903 --> 00:10:45,423
Oh. That's...
that's Happy. Look.

212
00:10:45,783 --> 00:10:48,683
He gave his room to May,
so he's sleeping down here.

213
00:10:52,353 --> 00:10:54,073
I have a weird question.

214
00:10:56,013 --> 00:10:58,593
Does any part of you feel
relieved about all of this?

215
00:11:01,873 --> 00:11:04,123
Ever since I got
bit by that Spider...

216
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:09,153
I've only had one week,
where my life has felt normal.

217
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,603
Well, kind of normal, I guess.

218
00:11:12,193 --> 00:11:13,193
And...

219
00:11:14,713 --> 00:11:16,463
That was when you found out.

220
00:11:16,533 --> 00:11:18,323
Because then, everyone
that was in my life

221
00:11:18,773 --> 00:11:20,543
that I wanted to
know... you know.

222
00:11:20,693 --> 00:11:22,183
And it was perfect.

223
00:11:22,203 --> 00:11:23,893
But now everybody knows. And...

224
00:11:25,943 --> 00:11:29,143
I am the most famous
person in the entire world...

225
00:11:30,263 --> 00:11:31,663
and I'm still broke.

226
00:11:35,993 --> 00:11:39,393
I'm... excited to
see you tomorrow.

227
00:11:41,293 --> 00:11:42,803
Yeah, me too.

228
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,203
Wrap it up.

229
00:11:44,243 --> 00:11:46,493
You both like each
other. We get it. Hang up.

230
00:11:46,613 --> 00:11:49,393
There's no new ground being
broken. Okay? I need my eight hours.

231
00:11:49,473 --> 00:11:50,639
Have you been listening this whole time?

232
00:11:50,663 --> 00:11:51,523
Hi, Happy.

233
00:11:51,633 --> 00:11:53,073
Not by choice.

234
00:11:53,123 --> 00:11:54,103
MJ says hi.

235
00:11:54,143 --> 00:11:55,143
Hello.

236
00:11:55,603 --> 00:11:59,583
We're covering the first day of senior year
for Midtown High's most famous student,

237
00:11:59,763 --> 00:12:02,683
Peter Parker! Go get 'em, Tiger!

238
00:12:03,213 --> 00:12:05,513
Or should I say, Spider?

239
00:12:05,543 --> 00:12:07,803
The crowd has
continued to grow here all

240
00:12:07,823 --> 00:12:10,643
morning long at the
Midtown School of Science...

241
00:12:10,673 --> 00:12:16,383
The crowd seems evenly divided between
supporters of Spider-Man, and protesters.

242
00:12:18,053 --> 00:12:22,503
MJ! MJ, we love you. MJ, are
you gonna have his spider-babies?

243
00:12:29,813 --> 00:12:32,463
Mysterio forever! Murderer!

244
00:12:32,783 --> 00:12:35,653
Back off!

245
00:12:35,683 --> 00:12:38,493
- Who are you?
- I'm Ned Leeds. I'm Spider-Man's...

246
00:12:38,523 --> 00:12:42,343
Peter Parker's best friend. You come
at my boy? You come at Flash Thompson.

247
00:12:42,373 --> 00:12:44,443
If you wanna read about
our inspiring friendship,

248
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:46,453
you can now with my
new book, Flashpoint.

249
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:50,263
One spider, two hearts, a million
crazy-ass memories. Check it out.

250
00:12:53,303 --> 00:12:55,743
- Go. Go. Go. Go. Go!
- No, wait up...

251
00:12:55,773 --> 00:12:57,833
I'll see you inside, okay?

252
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:03,593
Keep watching Midtown News all year as
we bring you upclose and personal coverage

253
00:13:03,653 --> 00:13:07,913
of Peter fighting his biggest
battle yet: college admissions.

254
00:13:12,223 --> 00:13:13,223
Peter.

255
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,333
We would love to...

256
00:13:14,733 --> 00:13:15,733
Welcome you back...

257
00:13:15,923 --> 00:13:17,423
To Midtown High.

258
00:13:17,543 --> 00:13:19,513
Where we shape heroes.

259
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,193
- Uh-huh.
- Or murderers.

260
00:13:21,403 --> 00:13:22,463
Stop it.

261
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:24,613
It's an honor to serve you...

262
00:13:25,383 --> 00:13:26,393
- Sir.
- God!

263
00:13:26,423 --> 00:13:27,563
Mysterio was right.

264
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:29,143
Stop. We don't... that's all.

265
00:13:29,373 --> 00:13:31,833
Some of the students
put this together for you.

266
00:13:32,123 --> 00:13:33,323
No. You did that.

267
00:13:33,553 --> 00:13:35,433
- You did that.
- I helped a little bit.

268
00:13:35,553 --> 00:13:37,873
I tried to stop him so many
times, but you piled through.

269
00:13:37,953 --> 00:13:39,259
- He did all of that.
- You did a great job.

270
00:13:39,283 --> 00:13:41,163
I hope you have time
to stop and check it out...

271
00:13:41,713 --> 00:13:42,933
And feel free to walk...

272
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:47,093
Or, or swing through the hallway... Or
crawl on the ceiling to avoid everybody.

273
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:48,413
We all know you can do it.

274
00:13:48,473 --> 00:13:49,483
I'm just gonna...

275
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:50,393
You know what you did.

276
00:13:50,423 --> 00:13:51,863
Stop it. You're
embarassing yourself.

277
00:13:51,943 --> 00:13:53,573
He's a conspiracy theorist.

278
00:14:07,903 --> 00:14:09,423
Can we just like,
stay up here all day?

279
00:14:09,913 --> 00:14:12,253
- It is so crazy down there.
- Wait, this one's good.

280
00:14:12,293 --> 00:14:13,293
Some suggest that,

281
00:14:13,433 --> 00:14:15,009
Parker's powers
include the male spider's

282
00:14:15,033 --> 00:14:17,803
ability to hypnotize females,

283
00:14:17,893 --> 00:14:20,533
which he used to
seduce Jones-Watson

284
00:14:20,613 --> 00:14:22,343
into his cult of personality.

285
00:14:22,373 --> 00:14:23,773
Stop! Stop.

286
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,963
Yes, my Spider-lord.

287
00:14:33,843 --> 00:14:35,553
Finally. Some privacy.

288
00:14:35,763 --> 00:14:37,133
It is so crazy down there.

289
00:14:38,423 --> 00:14:39,933
So, I was thinking...

290
00:14:40,573 --> 00:14:41,973
When we get into MIT,

291
00:14:42,263 --> 00:14:43,553
we should live together.

292
00:14:43,933 --> 00:14:44,963
Yeah, for sure.

293
00:14:44,983 --> 00:14:45,993
Yeah. Love that.

294
00:14:47,873 --> 00:14:49,333
- This is gonna be us.
- Yes.

295
00:14:49,483 --> 00:14:50,633
Minus the frisbee.

296
00:14:50,773 --> 00:14:53,283
- And the smiling.
- MIT's obviously the dream...

297
00:14:53,523 --> 00:14:55,453
But if we match-up
our backup schools,

298
00:14:55,543 --> 00:14:57,723
either way, we'll all
be together in Boston.

299
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,903
New school, new town.
I can Spider-Man there.

300
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:01,469
I mean they have
crime in Boston, right?

301
00:15:01,493 --> 00:15:02,849
- Yes. Yes, they do.
- Yeah, wicked crime.

302
00:15:02,873 --> 00:15:04,533
Yeah, so it'll be
like a fresh start.

303
00:15:07,153 --> 00:15:08,163
What's up?

304
00:15:08,613 --> 00:15:10,413
I don't know. I just
feel like if you don't...

305
00:15:11,013 --> 00:15:12,883
If you expect disappointment,

306
00:15:12,933 --> 00:15:15,013
then you can never
really get disappointed.

307
00:15:15,153 --> 00:15:16,373
Come on.

308
00:15:18,233 --> 00:15:19,233
It'll be a fresh start.

309
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,503
And, we'll all be together.

310
00:15:22,853 --> 00:15:24,153
Yeah. You're right.

311
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:25,533
Fresh start.

312
00:15:29,213 --> 00:15:30,303
Fresh start.

313
00:15:32,513 --> 00:15:33,933
First one's here!

314
00:15:38,433 --> 00:15:40,763
It's okay. It's a backup school.

315
00:15:41,623 --> 00:15:42,633
Peter?

316
00:15:45,013 --> 00:15:46,163
No?

317
00:15:48,423 --> 00:15:49,793
Last one.

318
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,333
MIT?

319
00:16:09,323 --> 00:16:10,323
Okay.

320
00:16:11,633 --> 00:16:12,963
- Ready?
- Jones...

321
00:16:13,193 --> 00:16:15,233
I told you to take down
the Halloween decorations...

322
00:16:15,263 --> 00:16:17,283
Actually, that was Sasha, so...

323
00:16:17,303 --> 00:16:19,143
Enough attitude, just do it.

324
00:16:20,373 --> 00:16:21,403
On it.

325
00:16:23,123 --> 00:16:24,679
- I feel like I'm gonna puke.
- Well, don't.

326
00:16:24,703 --> 00:16:26,713
Because, he will
just make me clean it.

327
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,183
This is our only shot.

328
00:16:28,203 --> 00:16:29,553
It's here, or nowhere.

329
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:30,703
Hey! Come on.

330
00:16:30,733 --> 00:16:32,083
Okay. You guys ready?

331
00:16:32,413 --> 00:16:33,853
Okay. On three.

332
00:16:34,133 --> 00:16:35,143
One...

333
00:16:35,513 --> 00:16:36,513
Two...

334
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:37,843
Three...

335
00:17:00,193 --> 00:17:01,203
No.

336
00:17:01,903 --> 00:17:03,693
No. You?

337
00:17:04,863 --> 00:17:08,983
"In light of recent
controversy, we are unable to

338
00:17:09,013 --> 00:17:11,773
consider your application at this time."

339
00:17:12,093 --> 00:17:13,583
This is so not fair.

340
00:17:13,803 --> 00:17:16,283
I mean, this is so not fair.
I didn't do anything wrong.

341
00:17:16,443 --> 00:17:18,873
And you guys definitely
didn't do anything wrong.

342
00:17:19,093 --> 00:17:22,093
Expect disappointment, and
you will never get disappointed.

343
00:17:28,693 --> 00:17:30,013
Busted!

344
00:17:35,553 --> 00:17:36,673
You guys didn't get in?

345
00:17:36,753 --> 00:17:39,113
Yeah. Because we're actually
friends with Spider-Man.

346
00:17:41,403 --> 00:17:42,413
Uhh, yeah...

347
00:17:42,883 --> 00:17:46,313
I better get going. There's
a mixer for new admissions...

348
00:17:46,343 --> 00:17:48,163
And... sorry, guys.

349
00:17:48,823 --> 00:17:50,603
Jones, what are you
doing? Get back to work.

350
00:17:50,633 --> 00:17:52,093
Yeah. Coming.

351
00:17:52,273 --> 00:17:53,313
You know what?

352
00:17:55,313 --> 00:17:56,803
I wouldn't change a thing.

353
00:17:58,473 --> 00:17:59,673
Me neither.

354
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:05,333
Although, I coulda just
showed this letter to my parents.

355
00:19:15,313 --> 00:19:16,063
Umm...

356
00:19:16,223 --> 00:19:17,233
Hi.

357
00:19:19,983 --> 00:19:20,993
Hi!

358
00:19:22,073 --> 00:19:23,573
I'm...

359
00:19:23,673 --> 00:19:26,563
The most famous
person in the world. I know.

360
00:19:27,923 --> 00:19:31,593
Wong. Try not to slip. We
don't have liability insurance.

361
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:37,393
- Is all this for a holiday party?
- No.

362
00:19:37,463 --> 00:19:40,323
One of the rotunda
gateways connects to Siberia.

363
00:19:40,653 --> 00:19:42,363
Blizzard blasted through.

364
00:19:44,323 --> 00:19:48,513
Because someone forgot to cast a
maintenance spell to keep the seals tight.

365
00:19:48,673 --> 00:19:51,813
That's right. He did. Because
he forgot I now have higher duties.

366
00:19:51,873 --> 00:19:53,123
Higher duties?

367
00:19:53,173 --> 00:19:55,503
The Sorcerer Supreme
has high duties, yes.

368
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,379
Wait, I thought you were
the Sorcerer Supreme?

369
00:19:57,403 --> 00:19:59,213
No. He got it on a technicality

370
00:19:59,263 --> 00:20:00,963
'cause I blipped for five years.

371
00:20:01,123 --> 00:20:02,743
Oh. Well, congratulations.

372
00:20:02,763 --> 00:20:04,083
If I'd been here, then I'd...

373
00:20:04,113 --> 00:20:06,643
Burned the place down.
You two, no one said

374
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:07,673
stop shoveling.

375
00:20:07,743 --> 00:20:08,753
So, Peter...

376
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,803
To what do I owe the pleasure?

377
00:20:10,953 --> 00:20:12,193
Right. Umm...

378
00:20:12,313 --> 00:20:14,073
I'm really sorry to
bother you, sir, but...

379
00:20:14,103 --> 00:20:16,403
Please. We saved half
the universe together.

380
00:20:16,433 --> 00:20:18,263
I think we're beyond
you calling me sir.

381
00:20:18,293 --> 00:20:19,973
Okay, uhh... Stephen.

382
00:20:20,013 --> 00:20:21,973
That feels weird,
but I'll allow it.

383
00:20:24,383 --> 00:20:25,393
When...

384
00:20:26,163 --> 00:20:28,143
When Mysterio
revealed my identity...

385
00:20:29,233 --> 00:20:31,763
My entire life got
screwed up, and...

386
00:20:32,203 --> 00:20:34,269
I was wondering, I mean, I don't
even know if this would actually work,

387
00:20:34,293 --> 00:20:35,923
but I was wondering if...

388
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:40,943
Maybe you could go back in time
and make it so that he never did?

389
00:20:42,683 --> 00:20:43,693
Peter...

390
00:20:43,883 --> 00:20:46,823
we tampered with the stability
of space-time to resurrect

391
00:20:46,893 --> 00:20:50,573
countless lives. You wanna do it again
now just because yours got messy?

392
00:20:50,763 --> 00:20:54,133
This isn't... it's not about me. I mean,
this is really hurting a lot of people.

393
00:20:54,183 --> 00:20:55,183
My...

394
00:20:55,493 --> 00:20:57,183
My Aunt May, Happy...

395
00:20:57,473 --> 00:20:59,193
My best friend, my
girlfriend, their futures

396
00:20:59,213 --> 00:21:01,423
are ruined just because
they know me, and...

397
00:21:01,663 --> 00:21:03,213
They've done nothing wrong.

398
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:05,423
I am so sorry, but...

399
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:07,473
even if I wanted to...

400
00:21:08,383 --> 00:21:10,833
I don't have the
Time Stone anymore.

401
00:21:13,203 --> 00:21:14,213
That's right.

402
00:21:17,823 --> 00:21:19,333
I'm really sorry if I...

403
00:21:20,163 --> 00:21:21,493
wasted your time.

404
00:21:21,743 --> 00:21:23,523
- You didn't...
- Just forget about it.

405
00:21:23,633 --> 00:21:26,533
He will. He's really
good at forgetting things.

406
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:30,803
Wong. You've actually
generated a good idea.

407
00:21:30,853 --> 00:21:31,813
What?

408
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:34,083
The runes of Cafkal.

409
00:21:34,323 --> 00:21:36,103
The runes of Cafkal.

410
00:21:36,263 --> 00:21:38,123
Oh, it's just a standard
spell of forgetting.

411
00:21:38,193 --> 00:21:41,583
Won't turn back time, but at least people
will forget that you were ever Spider-Man.

412
00:21:41,753 --> 00:21:43,493
- Seriously?
- No. Not seriously.

413
00:21:43,543 --> 00:21:46,903
That spell travels the dark borders
between known and unknown reality.

414
00:21:46,933 --> 00:21:48,433
It's too dangerous.

415
00:21:48,803 --> 00:21:50,713
God, we've used
it for a lot less.

416
00:21:50,733 --> 00:21:53,453
Do you remember the full
moon party at Kamar-Taj?

417
00:21:53,483 --> 00:21:55,113
- No.
- Exactly.

418
00:21:58,053 --> 00:21:59,933
Come on. Wong.

419
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,353
Hasn't he been through enough?

420
00:22:10,143 --> 00:22:12,043
Just leave me out of this.

421
00:22:12,473 --> 00:22:13,713
Fine.

422
00:22:14,993 --> 00:22:16,073
Fine.

423
00:22:27,773 --> 00:22:29,483
So what is this place?

424
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:34,213
The Sanctum's built at the
intersection of cosmic energy currents.

425
00:22:34,283 --> 00:22:36,133
We were the first
to seek them out.

426
00:22:36,193 --> 00:22:39,233
Some of these walls are
thousands of years old.

427
00:22:39,963 --> 00:22:42,653
And they shot an episode
of Equalizer here in the 80's.

428
00:22:43,563 --> 00:22:44,913
Well, I, umm...

429
00:22:46,653 --> 00:22:48,943
really appreciate you
doing this for me, sir.

430
00:22:49,193 --> 00:22:50,433
Don't mention it.

431
00:22:51,983 --> 00:22:53,473
And don't call me sir.

432
00:22:54,863 --> 00:22:56,023
Right. Sorry.

433
00:22:56,533 --> 00:22:57,533
You ready?

434
00:22:58,723 --> 00:22:59,793
I'm ready.

435
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:03,793
Nice knowing you, Spider-Man.

436
00:23:07,993 --> 00:23:09,533
Wait, excuse me?

437
00:23:10,923 --> 00:23:14,453
The entire world is about to forget
that Peter Parker is Spider-Man.

438
00:23:15,023 --> 00:23:16,693
- Including me.
- Everyone?

439
00:23:18,253 --> 00:23:21,393
- Can't some people still know?
- That's not how the spell works.

440
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:24,843
Very difficult and dangerous
to change it mid-casting.

441
00:23:25,143 --> 00:23:27,753
So my girlfriend is just gonna
forget about everything we've

442
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:29,093
been through? I mean, is she
even gonna be my girlfriend?

443
00:23:29,113 --> 00:23:31,259
That depends. Was she your girlfriend
just because you're Spider-Man, or...

444
00:23:31,283 --> 00:23:32,793
I don't know. I really hope not.

445
00:23:32,823 --> 00:23:33,963
Alright. Fine.

446
00:23:35,173 --> 00:23:37,563
Everyone in the world is
gonna forget you're Spider-Man,

447
00:23:37,613 --> 00:23:39,283
except your girlfriend.

448
00:23:39,303 --> 00:23:42,703
Thank you so much...
Oh, my God. Ned.

449
00:23:42,763 --> 00:23:46,063
- Ned!
- What is a Ned?

450
00:23:46,353 --> 00:23:49,153
He's my best friend so it's really
important to me that Ned knows.

451
00:23:53,493 --> 00:23:57,783
Okay. Let's not change the
parameters of the spell anymore...

452
00:23:57,983 --> 00:24:01,073
- While I'm casting it.
- Okay, I'm done. I swear I'm done.

453
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:03,143
But my Aunt May
should really know.

454
00:24:03,213 --> 00:24:04,963
Peter, stop tampering
with the spell.

455
00:24:04,993 --> 00:24:07,783
Once she found out that I was
Spider-Man, it was really messy, and

456
00:24:07,803 --> 00:24:10,543
I don't think that I can
go through with that again.

457
00:24:10,943 --> 00:24:12,393
- So, my Aunt May?
- Yes!

458
00:24:12,423 --> 00:24:15,233
- Oh, thank you. Happy?
- No. I am annoyed.

459
00:24:15,343 --> 00:24:17,263
No, it's a nickname.
Harold "Happy" Hogan.

460
00:24:17,343 --> 00:24:18,843
He used to work for Tony Stark...

461
00:24:18,943 --> 00:24:21,393
Could you just stop talking?

462
00:24:28,753 --> 00:24:33,203
Basically, everyone who knew that I
was Spider-Man before, should still know.

463
00:24:54,143 --> 00:24:55,503
- Did it work?
- No.

464
00:24:55,753 --> 00:24:59,123
- You changed my spell six times.
- Five times.

465
00:24:59,183 --> 00:25:01,793
You changed my spell.
You don't do that. I told you,

466
00:25:01,943 --> 00:25:03,443
and that is why.

467
00:25:03,873 --> 00:25:06,533
That spell was completely out
of control. If I hadn't shut it down,

468
00:25:06,623 --> 00:25:08,683
something catastrophic
could've happened.

469
00:25:08,903 --> 00:25:10,003
Stephen, listen,
I am so sorry...

470
00:25:10,023 --> 00:25:11,493
Call me sir.

471
00:25:13,923 --> 00:25:15,053
Sorry, sir.

472
00:25:16,233 --> 00:25:19,983
You know, after everything we've been
through together, somehow I always forget...

473
00:25:20,423 --> 00:25:21,763
You're just a kid.

474
00:25:22,673 --> 00:25:24,073
Look, part of the problem,

475
00:25:24,153 --> 00:25:25,583
it's not Mysterio.

476
00:25:25,723 --> 00:25:28,083
It's you. Trying to
live two different lives.

477
00:25:28,113 --> 00:25:31,423
And the longer you do that, the
more dangerous it becomes. Believe me.

478
00:25:31,793 --> 00:25:34,343
I'm so sorry about,
you and your friends,

479
00:25:34,753 --> 00:25:38,203
not getting into college,
but if they rejected you, and...

480
00:25:38,773 --> 00:25:42,353
you tried to convince them to reconsider,
there is nothing else you can do.

481
00:25:45,923 --> 00:25:47,303
When you say "convince them",

482
00:25:48,003 --> 00:25:49,733
you mean like, I
could've called them?

483
00:25:49,783 --> 00:25:50,783
Yeah.

484
00:25:51,263 --> 00:25:52,573
I can do that?

485
00:25:53,793 --> 00:25:55,403
You haven't called?

486
00:25:55,423 --> 00:25:57,693
Well, I mean, I got their
letter, and I assumed that...

487
00:25:57,763 --> 00:26:00,393
I'm sorry, but
are you telling me,

488
00:26:01,013 --> 00:26:03,943
that you didn't even think to
plead your case with them first,

489
00:26:03,973 --> 00:26:05,253
before you asked me to

490
00:26:05,283 --> 00:26:07,943
brainwash the entire world?

491
00:26:10,673 --> 00:26:12,363
I mean, when you
put it like that, then...

492
00:26:20,153 --> 00:26:21,683
Come on. Pick up,
pick up, pick up...

493
00:26:21,743 --> 00:26:24,723
- Dude, what? I'm busy.
- Flash, where's the MIT mixer?

494
00:26:24,773 --> 00:26:25,593
Why?

495
00:26:25,623 --> 00:26:26,999
Because, I need to come
and talk to someone. I'm

496
00:26:27,023 --> 00:26:29,263
trying to get Ned and MJ a
second chance at getting in.

497
00:26:29,343 --> 00:26:30,703
What's in it for me?

498
00:26:30,733 --> 00:26:32,223
I'm risking a lot
just talking to you.

499
00:26:32,293 --> 00:26:34,043
Okay. I will...

500
00:26:35,643 --> 00:26:37,853
Pick you up and swing
you to school for a week?

501
00:26:38,003 --> 00:26:39,093
For a month.

502
00:26:39,193 --> 00:26:40,333
For a week.

503
00:26:40,703 --> 00:26:42,613
- Two weeks.
- Flash, please. Come on, help me.

504
00:26:42,693 --> 00:26:43,693
You tell everyone...

505
00:26:45,723 --> 00:26:47,439
Okay, I'll tell everyone
that you're my best friend.

506
00:26:47,463 --> 00:26:49,013
Flash, please help me.

507
00:26:49,063 --> 00:26:49,773
Cool, cool, cool.

508
00:26:49,803 --> 00:26:52,503
So there's this lady. The assistant vice
chancellor. You can plead your case with her.

509
00:26:52,523 --> 00:26:53,903
Okay, perfect. Where is she?

510
00:26:53,933 --> 00:26:55,493
- She left.
- To go where?

511
00:26:55,523 --> 00:26:56,663
To the airport.

512
00:27:02,943 --> 00:27:04,953
Stark Network, unavailable.

513
00:27:05,403 --> 00:27:07,263
Facial recognition, unavailable.

514
00:27:11,043 --> 00:27:12,073
Hi.

515
00:27:14,013 --> 00:27:16,023
Yep. I can see you.

516
00:27:30,243 --> 00:27:31,273
Mom?

517
00:27:45,753 --> 00:27:46,753
Okay.

518
00:27:57,763 --> 00:27:58,763
Yeah.

519
00:27:59,083 --> 00:28:02,143
- Hi. I'm Peter Parker...
- You do know you're in the street, right?

520
00:28:02,223 --> 00:28:04,153
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.
I just, I really needed to

521
00:28:04,173 --> 00:28:06,513
talk to you, I know you're
on your way to the airport...

522
00:28:06,903 --> 00:28:09,779
MJ Watson and Ned Leeds are the two smartest
people I've ever met in my entire life,

523
00:28:09,803 --> 00:28:11,783
and I'm the dumbest
person, because...

524
00:28:11,803 --> 00:28:13,253
I let them help me, but
if I didn't let them help

525
00:28:13,273 --> 00:28:15,159
me, then millions of people
would've died, so please...

526
00:28:15,183 --> 00:28:17,863
- Don't let MIT be dumb like me.
- MIT is dumb?

527
00:28:17,893 --> 00:28:20,533
No! I'm saying don't
let MIT be dumb.

528
00:28:20,953 --> 00:28:21,963
I mean, like the...

529
00:28:21,993 --> 00:28:23,783
the dumber version of me that

530
00:28:23,803 --> 00:28:25,593
wouldn't have let them help.

531
00:28:26,963 --> 00:28:29,013
You didn't rehearse
that, did you, Peter?

532
00:28:30,473 --> 00:28:32,213
Basically, what I'm trying to...

533
00:28:40,143 --> 00:28:41,603
Why are you running? What...

534
00:28:45,453 --> 00:28:49,013
Oh, my God. Ma'am? You
should get out of the car.

535
00:28:49,083 --> 00:28:51,023
Everybody get off the bridge!

536
00:28:53,113 --> 00:28:55,693
We're locked. Doors... hey!

537
00:29:12,983 --> 00:29:14,503
Hello, Peter.

538
00:29:14,933 --> 00:29:16,023
Hi?

539
00:29:16,123 --> 00:29:19,163
- Have we... Do I know you?
- What have you done with my machine?

540
00:29:19,223 --> 00:29:20,233
Your ma...

541
00:29:20,263 --> 00:29:22,259
I don't know what you're
talking about. What machine?

542
00:29:22,283 --> 00:29:26,673
The power of the sun, in
the palm of my hand. It's gone.

543
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,833
Listen, sir. If you
stop smashing cars,

544
00:29:28,903 --> 00:29:31,633
we could work together and I
can help you find your machine.

545
00:29:31,723 --> 00:29:33,463
You wanna play games?

546
00:29:36,383 --> 00:29:37,473
Catch!

547
00:29:53,953 --> 00:29:56,293
It's okay. You guys are fine,
you're safe. Get out of here.

548
00:29:56,653 --> 00:29:59,233
You think your fancy
new suit's gonna save you?

549
00:30:13,983 --> 00:30:16,933
I should've killed your little
girlfriend when I had the chance.

550
00:30:21,123 --> 00:30:22,693
What did you just say?

551
00:30:22,943 --> 00:30:25,113
Looks like we got competition.

552
00:30:44,623 --> 00:30:47,083
Peter! Help!

553
00:31:08,943 --> 00:31:11,043
Don't worry, Ma'am! I'm coming!

554
00:31:13,113 --> 00:31:14,413
Peter!

555
00:31:40,933 --> 00:31:42,843
Ma'am, just stay calm.

556
00:31:42,883 --> 00:31:45,953
- Just take a deep breath. Are you okay?
- No!

557
00:31:47,983 --> 00:31:50,843
I've got it all under control.

558
00:31:57,723 --> 00:31:59,443
Suit compromised.

559
00:31:59,563 --> 00:32:01,423
Nanotechnology.

560
00:32:01,833 --> 00:32:04,713
You've outdone yourself, Peter.

561
00:32:10,393 --> 00:32:12,363
I underestimated you.

562
00:32:13,323 --> 00:32:14,873
But now, you die.

563
00:32:31,093 --> 00:32:33,063
You're not Peter Parker.

564
00:32:33,463 --> 00:32:35,263
I am so confused right now.

565
00:32:37,483 --> 00:32:40,453
- What's happening?
- New device detected.

566
00:32:42,373 --> 00:32:44,133
Pairing new device.

567
00:32:47,663 --> 00:32:50,523
Don't listen to him,
you listen to me.

568
00:32:56,453 --> 00:32:57,453
Hey.

569
00:33:10,413 --> 00:33:13,403
Hey. Hey! Listen to me.

570
00:33:13,903 --> 00:33:16,563
No, not him. Me!

571
00:33:22,933 --> 00:33:25,733
Ma'am are you okay? Come
on, you can still make your flight.

572
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:27,833
Peter.

573
00:33:29,533 --> 00:33:30,643
You're a hero.

574
00:33:30,783 --> 00:33:31,793
No. Well, I'm...

575
00:33:32,003 --> 00:33:33,013
No, I'm...

576
00:33:33,133 --> 00:33:35,453
I'm gonna talk to
admissions about your friends,

577
00:33:36,063 --> 00:33:37,693
and I'm gonna talk
to them about you.

578
00:33:38,413 --> 00:33:40,643
No, but, Ma'am,
this isn't about me.

579
00:33:41,063 --> 00:33:44,413
I'm going to talk to them
about your friends, and you.

580
00:33:44,763 --> 00:33:46,253
- Okay?
- Really?

581
00:33:46,283 --> 00:33:47,843
And if you keep
your noses clean,

582
00:33:47,903 --> 00:33:49,483
maybe you'll have a fair shot.

583
00:33:49,563 --> 00:33:51,913
Here. Get out of the
way. Let me get that man.

584
00:33:51,983 --> 00:33:53,163
You. I see you.

585
00:33:53,263 --> 00:33:54,263
Come here!

586
00:33:54,303 --> 00:33:55,393
That was not okay.

587
00:33:55,473 --> 00:33:56,553
Unbelievable.

588
00:34:00,603 --> 00:34:02,153
Until you stop
trying to kill me,

589
00:34:02,403 --> 00:34:03,593
I'm in control, buddy.

590
00:34:03,653 --> 00:34:06,373
Of this whole tentacle
situation you got going on here.

591
00:34:06,453 --> 00:34:09,983
Okay? Now, who are
you? What is going on...

592
00:34:26,893 --> 00:34:28,143
Osborn?

593
00:34:50,803 --> 00:34:51,803
Doctor?

594
00:34:59,943 --> 00:35:03,473
Be careful what
you wish for, Parker.

595
00:35:03,783 --> 00:35:05,213
Let me out of here!

596
00:35:05,263 --> 00:35:07,483
Can you please explain
to me what is going on?

597
00:35:07,553 --> 00:35:10,363
That little spell that you botched
where you wanted everyone to forget

598
00:35:10,393 --> 00:35:13,683
that Peter Parker is Spider-Man, it
started pulling in everyone who knows

599
00:35:13,703 --> 00:35:17,173
Peter Parker is Spider-Man,
from every universe into this one.

600
00:35:18,893 --> 00:35:20,013
From every universe?

601
00:35:20,153 --> 00:35:21,693
Who are you? Where am I?

602
00:35:21,733 --> 00:35:24,229
I think it's better if we don't
engage with him because, frankly,

603
00:35:24,253 --> 00:35:26,523
the Multiverse is a concept
about which we know

604
00:35:26,563 --> 00:35:28,203
frighteningly little.

605
00:35:29,473 --> 00:35:31,443
The multiverse is real?

606
00:35:31,553 --> 00:35:33,193
This shouldn't even be possible.

607
00:35:33,223 --> 00:35:34,239
But I thought you
stopped the spell?

608
00:35:34,263 --> 00:35:37,663
No, I contained it, but it would appear
that a few of them squeaked through.

609
00:35:37,893 --> 00:35:40,113
After you left, I detected
an otherworldly presence.

610
00:35:40,133 --> 00:35:45,943
I pursued it into the sewers, where I
found that slimy, green, son of a gun.

611
00:35:46,535 --> 00:35:47,545
Spell?

612
00:35:47,685 --> 00:35:48,875
As in, magic?

613
00:35:49,305 --> 00:35:50,915
What is this, a birthday party?

614
00:35:50,995 --> 00:35:52,395
Who is this clown?

615
00:35:52,695 --> 00:35:53,865
What is this madness?

616
00:35:53,935 --> 00:35:57,125
Watch this. Do you know a
Peter Parker who is Spider-Man?

617
00:35:57,195 --> 00:35:57,965
Yes.

618
00:35:58,035 --> 00:35:59,625
- Is that him?
- No.

619
00:35:59,665 --> 00:36:00,665
See?

620
00:36:01,835 --> 00:36:03,365
Okay, here's what we gotta do.

621
00:36:03,505 --> 00:36:04,825
I don't know how many of these

622
00:36:04,905 --> 00:36:06,845
- visitors we got...
- I saw another one.

623
00:36:07,085 --> 00:36:08,265
On the bridge.

624
00:36:08,505 --> 00:36:09,695
He was like a...

625
00:36:09,965 --> 00:36:11,715
Like a flying green elf.

626
00:36:11,865 --> 00:36:13,945
Well he sounds jolly. Why
don't you start with him?

627
00:36:14,055 --> 00:36:15,905
I need you to capture
them and bring them here,

628
00:36:15,975 --> 00:36:18,265
while I figure out
how to get them back.

629
00:36:18,475 --> 00:36:21,115
Before they destroy the
fabric of reality, or worse,

630
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:22,345
Wong finds out.

631
00:36:22,835 --> 00:36:24,095
Uhh... Doctor Strange?

632
00:36:24,665 --> 00:36:25,665
What?

633
00:36:26,135 --> 00:36:29,205
My friends and I just got a
second chance at getting into MIT.

634
00:36:29,345 --> 00:36:30,975
If the school sees
me fighting these...

635
00:36:31,005 --> 00:36:33,195
- crazy monsters,
- Hey, watch your mouth!

636
00:36:33,225 --> 00:36:36,225
- I'm sorry.
- You're seriously still talking about college?

637
00:36:42,125 --> 00:36:43,395
Hey, what did you just do?

638
00:36:43,415 --> 00:36:44,415
This.

639
00:36:50,335 --> 00:36:51,595
How did you do that?

640
00:36:51,755 --> 00:36:53,125
Lots of birthday parties.

641
00:36:59,865 --> 00:37:00,865
Hey!

642
00:37:04,175 --> 00:37:06,595
One shot, send them here,
and move on. You're welcome.

643
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:07,635
Get to work.

644
00:37:07,675 --> 00:37:08,735
Sir?

645
00:37:09,045 --> 00:37:10,155
Now what?

646
00:37:11,585 --> 00:37:13,195
I know this is my
mess, and I swear to you

647
00:37:13,215 --> 00:37:15,055
that I'll fix it, but I'm
gonna need some help.

648
00:37:18,326 --> 00:37:20,956
I can't believe I'm in
the Sanctum Sanctorum.

649
00:37:21,016 --> 00:37:22,306
Neither can I.

650
00:37:22,646 --> 00:37:23,656
So...

651
00:37:23,906 --> 00:37:27,342
How did you know you're made of magic Because
my nanna says that we have it in our family,

652
00:37:27,366 --> 00:37:29,416
and sometimes I get
these tinglings in my hand...

653
00:37:29,476 --> 00:37:30,976
You should talk
to your physician.

654
00:37:31,026 --> 00:37:31,826
Peter!

655
00:37:31,876 --> 00:37:32,886
- Hey!
- Hey.

656
00:37:33,966 --> 00:37:37,126
I'm so sorry for dragging you in this,
you just gotta help me find these guys...

657
00:37:37,156 --> 00:37:40,256
You don't have to apologize.
You got us a second shot at MIT.

658
00:37:40,936 --> 00:37:43,656
So, how did the
bad guys get here?

659
00:37:43,746 --> 00:37:46,256
He screwed up a spell
trying to get you into college.

660
00:37:46,766 --> 00:37:49,527
- Wait, what? I thought it was a magic laser?
- You did it with magic?

661
00:37:50,196 --> 00:37:52,826
No, that was after. Let's just
focus on the good news, okay?

662
00:37:52,856 --> 00:37:54,646
No, let's just focus
on the bad news.

663
00:37:54,696 --> 00:37:56,396
As of now, you have detected

664
00:37:56,466 --> 00:37:59,356
zero multiversal
trespassers, so...

665
00:37:59,416 --> 00:38:00,736
Get on your phones,

666
00:38:00,936 --> 00:38:02,636
scour the internet, and...

667
00:38:03,306 --> 00:38:05,006
Scooby-Doo this shit!

668
00:38:05,626 --> 00:38:07,176
You're telling us what to do,

669
00:38:07,256 --> 00:38:08,686
even though it was your spell,

670
00:38:08,736 --> 00:38:11,546
that got screwed up. Meaning
that all of this is kind of your mess.

671
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:12,786
You know, I know

672
00:38:12,926 --> 00:38:16,296
a couple of magic words myself,
starting with the word 'please'.

673
00:38:19,288 --> 00:38:21,978
Please, Scooby-Doo this shit.

674
00:38:22,388 --> 00:38:24,208
You can work in the undercroft.

675
00:38:25,218 --> 00:38:27,148
The undercroft?

676
00:38:32,161 --> 00:38:33,361
Badass.

677
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:41,156
Guys, listen. About
this whole spell thing...

678
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,800
It's totally okay.

679
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,510
- Wait, really?
- Yeah.

680
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,210
I mean, I get it. You were...

681
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:48,440
just trying to fix things...

682
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:49,880
And so...

683
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:52,620
Maybe just run it by us
next time, you know?

684
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,660
That way, when you're thinking, "Hey,
I'm about to do something that could...

685
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:59,410
break the universe",
we could like, help you.

686
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:01,220
Workshop something, or...

687
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,660
brainstorm ideas.

688
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,690
Deal.

689
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,130
Ned?

690
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:14,080
Oh, dude. I don't care.
And seriously, not a big deal.

691
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,990
A torture rack.

692
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:21,610
That is a pilates machine.

693
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,780
- That is...
- The crypt.

694
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:25,880
Okay, so we get
the rest of the guys.

695
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,050
You zap them, Doctor
Magic will send them back.

696
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,870
And when we get into MIT,

697
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:32,010
round of stale donuts, my treat.

698
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,930
Let's catch some multiverse men.

699
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:37,040
Hey! Who the hell are these two?

700
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:39,550
These are my friends.
This is MJ and this is Ned.

701
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:40,690
Hello.

702
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:42,510
I'm sorry, what was
your name again?

703
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,600
Dr. Otto Octavius.

704
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:51,090
Wait, no seriously,
what's your actual name?

705
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,950
Oh, is that a dinosaur?

706
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:16,599
If the paint won't come off, bring
it by the shelter and I'll get it out.

707
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,050
No, no, no, May.

708
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:20,180
We gotta find these guys first.

709
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:22,020
Well, finish your
mission, then come by.

710
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:24,230
We're having a
canned food drive.

711
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,330
I got one, I got one, I got one.

712
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,190
- Oh, May? I gotta go.
- Okay. Love you. Bye.

713
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:29,706
I mean you can take
the guy out of the chair

714
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:31,830
but you can't take
the chair out of the guy.

715
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:33,330
What did you find?

716
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:38,370
There's a disturbance near a military
research facility outside of the city.

717
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:42,150
And witnesses say they saw a
monster flying through the air.

718
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,806
That's gotta be the guy I
saw on the bridge, right?

719
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:47,180
That's impossible.

720
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,950
You know him, don't you?

721
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,980
On the bridge,
you said his name.

722
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,760
Norman Osborn.

723
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:58,990
Brilliant scientist.

724
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:00,810
Military researcher.

725
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,380
But he was greedy.

726
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,840
Misguided.

727
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:09,070
- What happened to him?
- We tire of your questions, boy!

728
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:11,540
Okay...

729
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,490
I gotta go. Where are we going?

730
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,100
It can't be him.

731
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:19,040
Why?

732
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:23,290
Because Norman
Osborn died years ago.

733
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,270
So either we saw someone else,

734
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:32,690
or you're flying out into
the darkness, to fight a ghost.

735
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,890
Keep an eye out on those trees,
we don't really know where this guy is.

736
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:04,440
I really don't know how you
do this without throwing up.

737
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:24,150
Did you guys see that?

738
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:26,190
No.

739
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:27,800
It's, it's really dark.

740
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:49,750
What's happening?

741
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:51,180
Peter, what is it?

742
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:54,730
Are you getting
the tingle thing?

743
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:57,030
Is the tingle thing happening?
Is your tingle tingling?

744
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,620
Are you guys seeing this?

745
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,800
- Yeah.
- Osborn?

746
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:11,760
No. He was green.
This guy's blue.

747
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:16,020
You wouldn't happen to be from
another universe, would you?

748
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:18,080
What's he doing?

749
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:19,870
I don't know. Looks
like he's charging.

750
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:21,790
I don't like this. Just web him.

751
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:37,030
Go left, left! Go left!

752
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:40,060
Wait! Right, right!

753
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:43,340
Guys!

754
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,330
This is not helping!

755
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:53,600
No, no, no. What happened?

756
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:54,910
Peter? Peter?

757
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,660
Whoa.

758
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:08,050
Peter, it's me. Flint
Marko. You remember?

759
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,760
I'm Peter, but
I'm not your Peter.

760
00:44:09,810 --> 00:44:12,870
What do you mean you're not my
Peter? What the hell is going on?

761
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:15,590
I'll explain everything, but first
can you help me stop this guy?

762
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:16,520
Okay.

763
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:18,710
Okay, try to surround
him and I'll pull the plug.

764
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:20,280
All right, let's go.

765
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,810
I can't hold him much longer.

766
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,160
I got him. I got it.

767
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:08,720
Different Peter. Weird.

768
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:09,960
Thanks.

769
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:11,330
Sorry.

770
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:12,580
Don't worry about it.

771
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,190
I got my body back.

772
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:23,960
Hey, umm...

773
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,980
This is gonna sound really
crazy, but this isn't your universe.

774
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:29,580
Another universe?

775
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:32,280
- What?
- That's what I was feeling.

776
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:35,070
The power. It's different.

777
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,620
I like it.

778
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:41,510
Easy, buddy.

779
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,730
It's actually my
fault that you're here.

780
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:46,830
Like the universe? Or the woods?

781
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:49,980
- I hate the woods.
- I meant the universe, sir.

782
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:53,480
So what? You guys just gonna stand
there and act like I ain't butt-ass naked?

783
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:55,680
- I am.
- Uhh, no, no...

784
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:11,550
What was that? What
did you just do to him?

785
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:12,590
No, no, no. It's okay.

786
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:13,640
Did you kill him?

787
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:16,190
Whoa, listen. I can explain everything.
You just have to trust me, please.

788
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:18,720
I don't trust you.
I don't know you.

789
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:23,050
What is this?

790
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,640
You picked the wrong side.

791
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,260
Connors?

792
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:32,050
What?

793
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:33,550
You know this creature?

794
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:36,250
No, no, no, no. Not
a creature. A man.

795
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,740
From same universes.

796
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:43,090
Dr. Curt Connors. He was a scientist
in Oscorp when I worked there.

797
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:44,550
A brilliant scientist.

798
00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:47,180
Till he turned himself
into a lizard. Then he tried

799
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:49,740
to turn the whole city
into lizards. It was crazy.

800
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:53,330
It wasn't crazy, Max. It was
the next step in human evolution.

801
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:54,830
The dinosaur can talk.

802
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:55,630
- Lizard.
- Right.

803
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:57,540
Speaking of which, what
happened to you? Last I

804
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:00,990
recall, you had bad teeth,
glasses and a comb-over.

805
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:03,230
Did you get a makeover?

806
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,460
You know I can give
you a real makeover.

807
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,760
- Let me guess. Into a lizard?
- Exactly.

808
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:11,600
Could you two just
shut up? Where are we?

809
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:13,370
- It's complicated.
- A wizard's dungeon.

810
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,140
Wizard's... Wizard's dungeon?

811
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,806
There's no real way
to sugarcoat that.

812
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:18,760
It's literally the
dungeon of a wizard.

813
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:20,370
Look, you can keep your magic.

814
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:24,090
I want a taste of that
new energy I just felt.

815
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:28,490
Oh, Peter. Hey.

816
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:30,490
Hey. Did those guys
come through yet?

817
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:32,630
There should be an
electric guy and a sand guy.

818
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,260
Yeah. They're all
here and locked up.

819
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:37,456
Perfect. I'm gonna just
stay here for a bit, and try

820
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,940
to fix this damage so they
don't blame it on me again.

821
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:42,280
- Okay.
- Hey, I...

822
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:45,520
I couldn't do any of
this without you, so...

823
00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:47,290
- Thank you.
- Yeah, of course.

824
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:50,590
Hey, ask him if this
is like a tree monster,

825
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:52,870
or like a scientist
that turned into a tree.

826
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,620
It's just a tree, man.

827
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:56,240
Just a tree.

828
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,800
Coward. We have a
new world to conquer.

829
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:22,220
- You make me sick.
- Leave me alone. Please.

830
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:24,860
Hiding in the shadows...

831
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,760
Hiding from who you truly are.

832
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:28,790
No!

833
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:31,480
You can't escape yourself!

834
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,590
- Hey, May.
- Hey, Peter.

835
00:48:48,810 --> 00:48:50,220
I'm at work, and, umm...

836
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:52,980
One of the guys you're
looking for just walked in.

837
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:04,450
May? Where's May? Thank you.

838
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:12,680
Hey. Here he is.

839
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:13,900
Norman,

840
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,660
this is my nephew.

841
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:19,100
Norman Osborn?

842
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:20,370
I thought that you were...

843
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,020
I saw Spider-Man in
an ad for this place.

844
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:26,650
And I thought he could help me.

845
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:28,650
But you're not him.

846
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:30,950
Wait, so you want
Spider-Man's help?

847
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:32,900
He just wandered in.

848
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:37,540
I didn't know where else to go.

849
00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:41,190
Someone's living in my house.

850
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:44,620
Oscorp doesn't exist.

851
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:47,690
My son...

852
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:52,960
Sometimes,

853
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:54,750
I'm not myself.

854
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:57,230
I'm...

855
00:49:57,910 --> 00:49:58,910
someone else.

856
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,010
And, everytime he's in
control, I can't remember.

857
00:50:02,030 --> 00:50:04,860
And now, I'm here, in
this place, in this city,

858
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:05,600
and I don't know...

859
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:08,460
I don't know what's
going on with me.

860
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,000
I don't... It doesn't
make sense.

861
00:50:12,030 --> 00:50:13,430
He's lost.

862
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:15,910
And I don't mean
just in the cosmos.

863
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:17,640
I mean in his mind.

864
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:22,150
Are they all like this?

865
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:23,870
Yeah.

866
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:27,080
Well, I mean they all have their
own, mental or physical issues.

867
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,260
Well, he needs help,
but maybe they all do.

868
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:32,940
What, you don't
mean... No, May, this...

869
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,230
This isn't my problem.

870
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:37,090
Peter, not your problem? Mmm?

871
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:38,410
May...

872
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:41,320
Their chance of getting help is way
better back where they came from.

873
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:43,510
Sending them home,

874
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,686
That's the best thing
that we can do for them.

875
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:46,790
For them?

876
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:48,520
Or for yourself?

877
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:52,540
Look around you.

878
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:54,180
This is what we do.

879
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:55,730
We help people.

880
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:58,800
This is what's best, for them.

881
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,450
Trust me.

882
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:04,440
But the fact remains,

883
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:07,000
Spider-Man is a menace!

884
00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:11,850
We'll be right back, after a brief word
from Daily Bugle supplements.

885
00:51:12,050 --> 00:51:14,760
The only other Daily fix you need.

886
00:51:14,850 --> 00:51:16,060
And, we're out.

887
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:19,700
What?

888
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:24,270
I got eyes on them.

889
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:25,736
He's with his aunt and
some guy I don't know.

890
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:26,560
You sure?

891
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:27,846
They're just leaving the shelter.

892
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:29,230
Okay. Don't lose him.

893
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:41,530
Thanks, May.

894
00:51:42,090 --> 00:51:43,450
Hope to see you again.

895
00:51:43,890 --> 00:51:44,900
Hey.

896
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:46,250
He trusts you.

897
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:47,730
So do I.

898
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:50,980
Thanks for cleaning my suit.

899
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,090
I'll see you later.

900
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:58,390
- Guys, this is Mr. Osborn.
- Hey, it's Doctor.

901
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:59,480
Sorry. Umm...

902
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:01,950
Dr. Osborn, these are
my friends, Ned and MJ.

903
00:52:02,670 --> 00:52:03,800
Mary Jane?

904
00:52:03,850 --> 00:52:06,220
It's Michelle Jones, actually.

905
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:09,340
Fascinating.

906
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:15,480
Do you think there
are other Ned Leedses?

907
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:30,050
Octavius?

908
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:35,330
Osborn?

909
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:39,370
- What... What happened to you?
- What happened to...

910
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:43,130
- You're the walking corpse.
- What do you mean?

911
00:52:43,210 --> 00:52:45,950
You died, Norman.

912
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:47,610
Years ago.

913
00:52:48,550 --> 00:52:49,820
You're insane.

914
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:51,430
God, I love it here.

915
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,110
What are you talking about?

916
00:52:53,530 --> 00:52:54,690
He's standing right there.

917
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:55,710
- He's not...
- Dead.

918
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:59,680
They both died. Fighting Spider-Man.

919
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,200
It was all over the news.

920
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:06,820
Green Goblin?

921
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:10,510
Impaled by the glider
he flew around on.

922
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:12,730
And a couple of years later...

923
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:14,650
You. Doc Ock.

924
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:16,940
Drowned in the river
with your machine.

925
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:18,250
That's nonsense.

926
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:21,340
Spider-Man was trying
to stop my fusion reactor.

927
00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:23,590
So I stopped him.

928
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,730
I had him, by the
throat... And then, I...

929
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:34,150
And then I was here.

930
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:36,130
Oh, please. Let me
tell you something.

931
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:39,440
I was whooping
Spider-Man's ass. He'll tell you.

932
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:42,050
And then he caused an
overload. I was stuck in the grid,

933
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:45,050
absorbing data. I was about
to turn into pure energy,

934
00:53:45,070 --> 00:53:46,890
and then...

935
00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:50,120
And then... Oh, shit.

936
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:52,260
I was about to die.

937
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:55,520
Max, do you know? Do I die?

938
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:02,180
- Oh, great. You caught another one.
- No, wait. Strange, he's not dangerous.

939
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:06,440
It's okay.

940
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,210
What is that?

941
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:12,990
It's an ancient relic.
The Machinati Codamus.

942
00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:16,620
I trapped your corrupted spell inside.
Once I've finished the proper ritual,

943
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:20,440
will reverse the spell. And send
these guys back to their universes.

944
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:21,980
And then what?

945
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:23,280
We perish?

946
00:54:23,410 --> 00:54:25,740
Nah. No thanks,
I'll pass on that.

947
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:28,300
Let me out of here. Peter!

948
00:54:28,970 --> 00:54:30,370
Strange...

949
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:32,650
We can't send
them back. Not yet.

950
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:33,870
Why?

951
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:37,580
Some of these
guys are gonna die.

952
00:54:37,810 --> 00:54:38,980
Parker...

953
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,470
it's their fate.

954
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:44,150
Come on, Strange. Have a heart.

955
00:54:45,830 --> 00:54:48,390
In the grand calculus
of the multiverse,

956
00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:53,120
their sacrifice means
infinitely more than their lives.

957
00:54:59,010 --> 00:55:00,380
I'm sorry, kid.

958
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:03,340
If they die, they die.

959
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:18,520
Peter!

960
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:33,190
Don't!

961
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:38,550
- Dude, what are you doing?
- Peter, you gotta go. Go!

962
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:43,260
This is why I never had kids.

963
00:55:57,830 --> 00:55:58,950
- Give me the box.
- No.

964
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:00,990
Whoa!

965
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:19,180
Oh, my God. I'm dead.

966
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:22,070
You're not dead. You've just been
separated from your physical form.

967
00:56:22,290 --> 00:56:24,110
My physical... What?!

968
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:28,000
- How are you doing that?
- I have no idea.

969
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:30,190
You should not
be able to do that.

970
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:32,010
This feels amazing.

971
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:44,316
That might be one of
the coolest things that's

972
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:46,520
ever happened to me. But
don't ever do that again.

973
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,010
Hey. Get off of me!

974
00:57:42,910 --> 00:57:44,260
What is this place?

975
00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:46,980
The Mirror Dimension.
Where I'm in control.

976
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:59,230
Strange, stop. Can we
please just talk about this?

977
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:01,720
Parker, don't you realize
that in the multiverse,

978
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:04,090
there are an infinite
number of people

979
00:58:04,110 --> 00:58:06,350
who know Peter
Parker is Spider-Man.

980
00:58:06,410 --> 00:58:09,330
And if that spell gets
loose, they're all coming here.

981
00:58:09,410 --> 00:58:12,630
Look, I know. I get it. But we
can't just send them home to die.

982
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,029
It's their fate.

983
00:58:14,030 --> 00:58:17,250
You can't change that anymore
than you can change who they are.

984
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:20,740
But what if we could? What
if we can change their fate?

985
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:23,930
What are you doing?

986
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:30,300
I'm not giving you the...

987
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:42,730
Give me that back.

988
00:59:03,530 --> 00:59:06,160
Wait a minute, is that
an Archimedean spiral?

989
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:09,750
The Mirror Dimension is just geometry? You're
great at geometry. You can do geometry.

990
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:15,220
Square the radius, divided
by, plot points along the curve...

991
00:59:15,290 --> 00:59:18,760
It's over, Parker. I'll come
pick you up when it's done.

992
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:25,270
Hey, Strange. You know
what's cooler than magic?

993
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:30,070
Math.

994
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:31,730
Don't do this.

995
00:59:34,290 --> 00:59:35,210
Oww.

996
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:36,800
I'm sorry, sir, but...

997
00:59:40,850 --> 00:59:42,510
I have to try.

998
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:46,190
Dude, what happened?

999
00:59:46,210 --> 00:59:48,090
I just had a fight with
Doctor Strange and I totally won!

1000
00:59:48,110 --> 00:59:50,340
- What?
- Look, and I stole his ring thing.

1001
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:53,210
I was swinging through the
city, and then I went through this...

1002
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:54,860
massive mirror thing,

1003
00:59:54,990 --> 00:59:56,610
- and then I was back...
- Where is he? Where is he?

1004
00:59:56,630 --> 00:59:57,680
He's trapped, but...

1005
00:59:57,690 --> 00:59:58,760
I'm not sure for how long.

1006
00:59:58,770 --> 01:00:00,640
You could've just left us to die.

1007
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:02,040
Why didn't you?

1008
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:03,690
Because that's not who he is.

1009
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:08,800
I think I can help you guys.

1010
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:10,840
If I can fix what
happened to you,

1011
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,850
then when you go back,
things will be different

1012
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,370
and you might not die
fighting Spider-Man.

1013
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:16,500
What do you mean fix us?

1014
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:19,010
- Look, our technology is advanced...
- I can help you.

1015
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:22,760
You know, I'm something
of a scientist myself.

1016
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:26,160
Octavius knows what I can do.

1017
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:28,620
Fix? You mean like a dog?

1018
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:30,080
I refuse.

1019
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:31,890
I can't promise
you guys anything,

1020
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:35,230
but at least this way, we actually
get to go home and have a chance.

1021
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:36,690
A second chance.

1022
01:00:37,270 --> 01:00:39,070
I mean, come on.
Isn't that worth trying?

1023
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,520
Trust me, Peter...

1024
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:42,480
When you try to fix people,

1025
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:45,320
there are always consequences.

1026
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:46,980
I mean, you don't have to come.

1027
01:00:47,590 --> 01:00:49,110
I also didn't know
that you could talk.

1028
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:50,690
But if you stay here...

1029
01:00:51,310 --> 01:00:53,000
you're gonna have to
deal with the wizard.

1030
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:55,650
So, we go along, or die.

1031
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:57,430
Not much of a choice, is it?

1032
01:00:57,630 --> 01:00:59,060
I just wanna go home.

1033
01:00:59,130 --> 01:01:01,410
Well, I myself don't
wanna be killed,

1034
01:01:01,590 --> 01:01:04,580
especially by a guy dressed
like Dungeons & Dragons, so...

1035
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:06,340
What's your plan?

1036
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:09,650
I have it all under control.

1037
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:14,830
What are we gonna
do about this thing?

1038
01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:17,830
Well, we need to find
somewhere safe for it, right?

1039
01:01:17,850 --> 01:01:19,220
- Yeah. Yes. Yes.
- You got to take it.

1040
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:19,910
Wait, what?

1041
01:01:19,970 --> 01:01:22,376
If something bad happens, I'll
text you, and then you just push this

1042
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:23,846
and then it's all over,
and they'll all be gone.

1043
01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:25,070
We're going with you.
We're not gonna leave you.

1044
01:01:25,090 --> 01:01:27,440
You can't come with me. It's too dangerous.
You guys have already done enough.

1045
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:29,910
- Peter, we're in this together.
- I know we're in this together, Ned,

1046
01:01:29,930 --> 01:01:32,560
but I can't do this if I
know that you're in danger.

1047
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:35,360
Okay? So for me, MJ,
please just take this.

1048
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:38,900
Please.

1049
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:41,080
- Fine.
- Thank you.

1050
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:44,080
But Peter, I swear, if I don't hear
from you, I'm pressing the button.

1051
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:46,840
- Sure.
- Okay. And I will do it!

1052
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:49,730
Yeah, we all
believe you, Michelle.

1053
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:52,630
No way that's his
girlfriend. No way.

1054
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:55,700
- She'll do it.
- Absolutely. She will.

1055
01:01:56,490 --> 01:01:57,490
Okay.

1056
01:01:58,500 --> 01:01:59,400
- See you later.
- Be safe.

1057
01:01:59,430 --> 01:02:00,430
You too.

1058
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:03,660
Whoa.

1059
01:02:05,010 --> 01:02:06,080
Okay.

1060
01:02:08,010 --> 01:02:10,160
- Be careful, okay?
- Yeah. You too.

1061
01:02:17,550 --> 01:02:18,760
So, uhh...

1062
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:21,580
Who's coming with me?

1063
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:26,570
Well, I'm in.

1064
01:02:26,990 --> 01:02:29,880
But, if this goes sideways...

1065
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:32,990
I'm gonna fry you
from the inside out.

1066
01:02:45,330 --> 01:02:48,060
- Where's Connors?
- He told me he wants to stay in the truck.

1067
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,870
- Okay.
- Alarm systems, deactivated.

1068
01:02:51,610 --> 01:02:52,900
Okay.

1069
01:02:53,990 --> 01:02:56,600
I feel kinda bad using
Happy's place like this.

1070
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:58,570
No, no, no, no.
He'll get over it.

1071
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:03,910
Sorry.

1072
01:03:04,090 --> 01:03:06,010
So this is your plan, Peter?

1073
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:07,050
Mmm?

1074
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:10,160
No lab, no facilities, just performing
miracles in a condominium?

1075
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:14,180
What, you're gonna cook up some churros,
some frozen burritos in a microwave?

1076
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:15,770
I could go for a burrito.

1077
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:17,270
He's gonna kill us all.

1078
01:03:17,330 --> 01:03:18,750
Well, let's hope not.

1079
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:20,870
You're up first, Doc.

1080
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:23,580
What? Hey, I told
you. I don't need fixing.

1081
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:26,160
I don't need fixing!

1082
01:03:26,550 --> 01:03:30,360
Especially by a teenager using
scraps from a bachelor's junk drawer.

1083
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:32,050
No, no, no, no.

1084
01:03:32,170 --> 01:03:33,630
He got something back there.

1085
01:03:33,770 --> 01:03:34,920
I can feel it.

1086
01:03:35,090 --> 01:03:36,230
Weird energy.

1087
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:38,480
What the hell is that?

1088
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:40,550
It's a fabricator.

1089
01:03:40,790 --> 01:03:44,410
It can analyze, design,
construct basically anything.

1090
01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:47,470
I thought that was a
tanning bed Happy broke.

1091
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:51,330
Look at that.

1092
01:03:58,790 --> 01:04:00,140
He's gonna kill us all.

1093
01:04:11,510 --> 01:04:12,946
So, the chip in the
back of Doc's neck

1094
01:04:12,970 --> 01:04:15,550
was designed to protect
his brain from the A.I. system

1095
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:18,500
that's controlling these
tentacles. But if you look here...

1096
01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:21,830
The chip is fried.

1097
01:04:21,850 --> 01:04:23,780
So rather than him
being in control of the

1098
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:25,880
tentacles, the tentacles
are now in control of him.

1099
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:28,040
Which, I guess explains why...

1100
01:04:28,450 --> 01:04:30,900
he is so miserable all the time.

1101
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:40,670
Thirsty?

1102
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:45,290
Well, yes. I am thirsty.

1103
01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:47,640
Fresh water or salt?

1104
01:04:48,590 --> 01:04:50,580
You know, because
you're an octopus.

1105
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:53,160
What?

1106
01:04:54,730 --> 01:04:56,050
Fresh water it is.

1107
01:04:57,170 --> 01:04:58,490
Look at this place.

1108
01:04:59,350 --> 01:05:00,600
And all the possibilities.

1109
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:02,370
What? This condo?

1110
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:05,530
Yeah. Yeah, the condo. I love
the whole overfloor plan. No!

1111
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:07,940
No, man. I'm talking
about the world.

1112
01:05:09,230 --> 01:05:10,960
I kinda like who I am here.

1113
01:05:12,690 --> 01:05:17,090
And all that power back
there? I could be so much more.

1114
01:05:17,870 --> 01:05:19,200
So why did you come here?

1115
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:20,620
I have a daughter.

1116
01:05:20,710 --> 01:05:24,540
And I wanna see her. But he's
not gonna send anyone home.

1117
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:27,460
Till he's finished his little
science project back there.

1118
01:05:28,530 --> 01:05:31,010
- You trust him?
- I don't trust anyone.

1119
01:05:32,050 --> 01:05:33,910
How'd you end up
like that anyway?

1120
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:37,260
The place where I worked at...

1121
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,570
They were experimenting
with electricity

1122
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:42,080
created by living
organisms, and then...

1123
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:45,200
I fell into a vat
of electric eels.

1124
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:46,800
You're kidding.

1125
01:05:46,950 --> 01:05:48,620
I fell into a supercollider.

1126
01:05:48,730 --> 01:05:49,740
Damn.

1127
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:52,180
Gotta be careful where you fall.

1128
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:54,860
Remarkable.

1129
01:05:56,050 --> 01:05:58,290
The technology and you.

1130
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:02,550
When all this is over,

1131
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:04,900
if you need a job and you're

1132
01:06:04,990 --> 01:06:07,740
willing to commute
to another universe...

1133
01:06:14,180 --> 01:06:16,910
It worked. That totally worked!

1134
01:06:17,630 --> 01:06:19,770
I got it. I did it. I did
it. Will you send him up?

1135
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:20,830
Yup. Here we go.

1136
01:06:22,090 --> 01:06:23,720
- Sorry.
- Hold on, Doc.

1137
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:26,280
All of these
humiliations never cease.

1138
01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:29,340
You! Keep your science
fair project away from me!

1139
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:30,890
Hey, it will work. Have faith.

1140
01:06:31,010 --> 01:06:33,800
Says the reckless fool who
turned himself into a monster.

1141
01:06:35,230 --> 01:06:38,540
Please stop. Hold still.

1142
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,150
Don't you dare.

1143
01:06:45,420 --> 01:06:48,340
I swear... when I get out
of this wicker, I'm gonna...

1144
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:54,570
Doc?

1145
01:07:00,470 --> 01:07:01,470
Doc?

1146
01:07:03,410 --> 01:07:04,410
Doc?

1147
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:06,690
Doctor Octavius?

1148
01:07:13,620 --> 01:07:15,120
It's so quiet...

1149
01:07:18,730 --> 01:07:19,790
Those voices...

1150
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:21,590
Inside my head...

1151
01:07:26,740 --> 01:07:28,020
I'd almost forgotten...

1152
01:07:29,610 --> 01:07:30,720
Otto.

1153
01:07:31,540 --> 01:07:32,550
Yes.

1154
01:07:32,830 --> 01:07:34,140
Norman.

1155
01:07:39,860 --> 01:07:41,040
It's me.

1156
01:07:43,390 --> 01:07:45,040
Would you look at that.

1157
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:08,470
I'm grateful, dear boy. Truly.

1158
01:08:08,590 --> 01:08:10,300
Yeah. You're welcome.

1159
01:08:10,470 --> 01:08:12,160
How can I help?

1160
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,510
This is Peter. Leave a message.

1161
01:08:15,580 --> 01:08:19,080
Yeah, Peter, this is Happy. I
accessed my doorbell camera...

1162
01:08:19,130 --> 01:08:21,580
Who are those guys,
huh? Is that a cyborg, you

1163
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,810
bring a cyborg with robot
legs into my house?

1164
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:26,570
One of the guys was made of
mud? What's going on? Call me back.

1165
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:37,180
How does it feel, Norman?

1166
01:08:38,410 --> 01:08:40,160
You're about to
become whole again.

1167
01:08:41,590 --> 01:08:43,150
No more darker half.

1168
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:45,400
Just you.

1169
01:08:46,370 --> 01:08:47,440
Just me.

1170
01:08:56,740 --> 01:08:57,940
Okay. Umm...

1171
01:08:59,450 --> 01:09:01,410
It just goes right
here, this one...

1172
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:03,950
That should be drawing power now.

1173
01:09:03,970 --> 01:09:06,300
I'm gonna come back in a
second just to check on it, but...

1174
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:08,640
Keep an eye on the lights.
When they're all green, it

1175
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:10,920
means all the electricity
in your body's dissipated.

1176
01:09:10,950 --> 01:09:12,096
Well, not all the electricity.

1177
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:15,180
I mean, obviously you know you need
electricity for your brain to function...

1178
01:09:15,230 --> 01:09:16,230
Your nervous system is...

1179
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:19,530
I'm not really sure why I'm
explaining electricity to you.

1180
01:09:20,050 --> 01:09:21,830
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

1181
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:23,630
Are these your legos?

1182
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:26,440
I gotta go.

1183
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:27,810
I'll be back.

1184
01:09:33,550 --> 01:09:36,340
- Something feels off.
- What do you mean?

1185
01:09:36,670 --> 01:09:39,270
- I don't like this.
- Leave it alone.

1186
01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:43,340
The sooner you guys get through
with this, the sooner we go home.

1187
01:09:51,388 --> 01:09:53,698
- Well? Where is he?
- He's inside.

1188
01:09:53,768 --> 01:09:57,248
And yet here we are outside. Did
you not hear me say don't lose him?

1189
01:09:57,668 --> 01:09:59,497
I want incriminating
footage of Spider-Man.

1190
01:09:59,522 --> 01:10:01,013
I already called
Damage Control...

1191
01:10:24,318 --> 01:10:25,678
Peter?

1192
01:10:26,938 --> 01:10:29,988
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

1193
01:10:31,188 --> 01:10:32,308
May?

1194
01:10:37,818 --> 01:10:39,578
What is it, Peter?

1195
01:10:46,358 --> 01:10:47,848
What's up, Peter?

1196
01:10:54,658 --> 01:10:56,768
Why are you looking
at me like that?

1197
01:11:12,158 --> 01:11:16,998
That's some neat trick.
That sense of yours.

1198
01:11:17,058 --> 01:11:17,918
Norman?

1199
01:11:17,968 --> 01:11:20,048
Norman's on sabbatical, Honey.

1200
01:11:21,118 --> 01:11:22,118
The hell?

1201
01:11:22,148 --> 01:11:23,518
Goblin.

1202
01:11:24,518 --> 01:11:29,928
No more darker half? Did you
really think that I'd let that happen?

1203
01:11:30,168 --> 01:11:33,088
That I'd let you take away
my power just because

1204
01:11:33,108 --> 01:11:36,288
you're blind to what
true power can bring you?

1205
01:11:36,308 --> 01:11:38,308
- You don't know me.
- Don't I?

1206
01:11:42,208 --> 01:11:44,128
I saw how she trapped you.

1207
01:11:44,548 --> 01:11:47,868
Fighting her holy moral mission.

1208
01:11:49,998 --> 01:11:52,278
We don't need you to save us.

1209
01:11:52,378 --> 01:11:54,568
We don't need to be fixed.

1210
01:11:57,828 --> 01:12:00,238
These are not curses.

1211
01:12:01,488 --> 01:12:02,928
They're gifts.

1212
01:12:03,978 --> 01:12:04,948
Norman, no.

1213
01:12:04,968 --> 01:12:07,598
- Quiet, lapdog.
- You don't know what you're talking about.

1214
01:12:07,658 --> 01:12:12,548
I watched you from deep
behind Norman's cowardly eyes.

1215
01:12:13,748 --> 01:12:19,048
Struggling, to have
everything you want,

1216
01:12:19,098 --> 01:12:22,648
while the world tries
to make you choose.

1217
01:12:24,538 --> 01:12:27,698
Gods don't have to choose.

1218
01:12:29,868 --> 01:12:31,268
We take.

1219
01:12:31,368 --> 01:12:33,128
May, run!

1220
01:12:56,298 --> 01:12:59,368
Oh, my God. What have you done?

1221
01:12:59,508 --> 01:13:01,568
I liked you better before.

1222
01:13:10,468 --> 01:13:13,878
Up here! He's up there.
It's the guy from the bridge.

1223
01:13:36,568 --> 01:13:38,278
Did you see that?

1224
01:14:03,958 --> 01:14:05,678
Get off me!

1225
01:14:14,788 --> 01:14:17,558
Strong enough to have it all...

1226
01:14:20,428 --> 01:14:22,348
Too weak to take it!

1227
01:14:57,578 --> 01:14:59,168
Now I've gotcha.

1228
01:15:01,108 --> 01:15:03,238
I told you there'd
be consequences!

1229
01:15:21,308 --> 01:15:23,238
Your weakness, Peter...

1230
01:15:23,528 --> 01:15:25,058
is morality.

1231
01:15:25,288 --> 01:15:27,358
It's choking you.

1232
01:15:28,018 --> 01:15:29,948
Can you feel it?

1233
01:15:37,578 --> 01:15:39,088
It didn't work.

1234
01:15:40,148 --> 01:15:41,748
Norman was right.

1235
01:15:42,008 --> 01:15:43,104
He got it from
you. That pathetic

1236
01:15:43,128 --> 01:15:46,088
sickness!

1237
01:15:50,238 --> 01:15:52,238
You tried to fix me...

1238
01:15:52,818 --> 01:15:54,508
May, go... May...

1239
01:15:54,528 --> 01:15:56,628
Now, I'm gonna fix you.

1240
01:16:00,408 --> 01:16:01,918
May, run, please...

1241
01:16:05,478 --> 01:16:06,478
May!

1242
01:16:12,398 --> 01:16:14,768
Peter, Peter, Peter...

1243
01:16:15,308 --> 01:16:18,068
No good deed goes unpunished.

1244
01:16:18,978 --> 01:16:21,128
You can thank me later.

1245
01:16:27,078 --> 01:16:28,078
No!

1246
01:16:57,798 --> 01:16:58,918
- May?
- Peter...

1247
01:16:58,948 --> 01:17:00,718
May, May... I'm here.

1248
01:17:05,308 --> 01:17:06,668
I'm here.

1249
01:17:07,498 --> 01:17:09,848
- Are you okay?
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

1250
01:17:14,148 --> 01:17:15,188
Really?

1251
01:17:15,208 --> 01:17:16,218
Yeah.

1252
01:17:16,478 --> 01:17:18,358
It's okay. We're okay, right?

1253
01:17:18,398 --> 01:17:18,898
Yeah.

1254
01:17:18,918 --> 01:17:20,118
Knocked off my head.

1255
01:17:20,388 --> 01:17:21,658
- Yeah, me too.
- That's all.

1256
01:17:23,978 --> 01:17:25,618
I think I broke my ribs.

1257
01:17:30,658 --> 01:17:32,088
This is all my fault, May.

1258
01:17:32,188 --> 01:17:34,668
I should've just listened to
Strange and let him send them back...

1259
01:17:34,688 --> 01:17:35,988
You did the right thing.

1260
01:17:36,968 --> 01:17:38,348
They would have been killed.

1261
01:17:38,658 --> 01:17:39,838
You did the right thing.

1262
01:17:40,208 --> 01:17:42,428
It's not my responsibility, May.

1263
01:17:46,208 --> 01:17:47,658
What Norman said?

1264
01:17:48,768 --> 01:17:50,418
My moral mission. No.

1265
01:17:50,508 --> 01:17:53,088
No, Peter. Listen.
You listen to me.

1266
01:17:54,248 --> 01:17:55,498
You have a gift.

1267
01:17:56,848 --> 01:17:58,268
You have power.

1268
01:17:59,098 --> 01:18:00,538
And with great power,

1269
01:18:00,658 --> 01:18:03,968
there must also come
great responsibility.

1270
01:18:09,278 --> 01:18:10,278
Yeah. I know.

1271
01:18:10,778 --> 01:18:12,678
Let's get out of here.

1272
01:18:12,708 --> 01:18:14,068
Okay, let's go.

1273
01:18:32,808 --> 01:18:34,618
What happened? Are you okay?

1274
01:18:34,768 --> 01:18:36,858
Yeah, you're okay.
What happened?

1275
01:18:38,358 --> 01:18:41,558
Just have to... to
catch my breath...

1276
01:18:41,658 --> 01:18:43,458
Okay. Well, catch your
breath. I'm right here.

1277
01:18:43,588 --> 01:18:44,778
We're gonna take our time,

1278
01:18:44,858 --> 01:18:46,018
you catch your breath, and...

1279
01:18:46,058 --> 01:18:47,878
and we'll take you
to a Doctor, okay?

1280
01:19:06,348 --> 01:19:07,348
Are you okay?

1281
01:19:08,528 --> 01:19:09,884
Somebody help. I
need an ambulance.

1282
01:19:09,908 --> 01:19:11,378
Please, somebody...

1283
01:19:11,548 --> 01:19:12,548
What happened?

1284
01:19:12,588 --> 01:19:15,918
Nothing. You're okay. You're okay.

1285
01:19:17,838 --> 01:19:20,438
I'll just... catch my breath...

1286
01:19:20,528 --> 01:19:22,538
Okay. I'm right
here. I'm right here.

1287
01:19:22,868 --> 01:19:23,998
I'm right here.

1288
01:19:30,858 --> 01:19:32,008
We're okay.

1289
01:19:33,588 --> 01:19:34,758
Just me and you.

1290
01:19:44,498 --> 01:19:45,508
May?

1291
01:19:52,198 --> 01:19:53,208
May?

1292
01:19:59,498 --> 01:20:01,288
Will you look at
me, May? Please?

1293
01:20:09,408 --> 01:20:12,548
May? May?

1294
01:20:14,348 --> 01:20:18,268
What are you doing, May? Please, will
you just wake up and talk to me, please?

1295
01:20:53,698 --> 01:20:54,828
Peter!

1296
01:20:59,108 --> 01:21:01,228
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1297
01:21:09,338 --> 01:21:10,338
Run!

1298
01:21:34,118 --> 01:21:35,418
Tragedy.

1299
01:21:38,858 --> 01:21:40,758
What else can I call it?

1300
01:21:41,608 --> 01:21:43,238
What more need be said?

1301
01:21:43,968 --> 01:21:45,128
The damage...

1302
01:21:45,998 --> 01:21:47,258
The destruction...

1303
01:21:47,808 --> 01:21:49,628
You saw it with your own eyes.

1304
01:21:50,888 --> 01:21:53,628
When will people
wake up, and realize

1305
01:21:53,738 --> 01:21:56,158
that everywhere
Spider-Man goes...

1306
01:21:56,318 --> 01:21:59,508
Chaos and calamity ensue.

1307
01:21:59,628 --> 01:22:04,248
Everything Spider-Man
touches comes to ruin.

1308
01:22:05,288 --> 01:22:09,678
And we, the innocents, are
left to pick up the pieces.

1309
01:22:12,368 --> 01:22:14,068
J. Jonah Jameson, reporting.

1310
01:22:14,098 --> 01:22:15,378
Good night.

1311
01:22:16,008 --> 01:22:17,678
And God help us all.

1312
01:22:45,058 --> 01:22:46,238
Still nothing?

1313
01:22:47,738 --> 01:22:48,738
No.

1314
01:23:04,778 --> 01:23:05,898
I'm gonna press it.

1315
01:23:07,738 --> 01:23:10,068
- What? No!
- Peter told me to wait, but...

1316
01:23:11,648 --> 01:23:12,758
I'm gonna do it.

1317
01:23:12,778 --> 01:23:15,498
I just wish... I just wish
that we could see him.

1318
01:23:20,858 --> 01:23:22,298
- Ned?
- Yeah?

1319
01:23:22,518 --> 01:23:23,748
Do that again.

1320
01:23:24,028 --> 01:23:25,038
Yeah.

1321
01:23:26,988 --> 01:23:28,828
I just wish we could see him.

1322
01:23:32,058 --> 01:23:33,058
Okay...

1323
01:23:33,478 --> 01:23:35,478
I just wish we could see Peter.

1324
01:23:40,878 --> 01:23:42,268
Salamangkero!

1325
01:23:42,388 --> 01:23:44,458
You're right. I am magic.

1326
01:23:45,468 --> 01:23:48,668
- Is that him?
- Yeah, yeah. It has to be.

1327
01:23:48,738 --> 01:23:50,638
- Peter. Peter!
- Hey, Peter!

1328
01:23:50,698 --> 01:23:51,698
Peter!

1329
01:23:59,978 --> 01:24:01,688
Hi. Hi!

1330
01:24:01,978 --> 01:24:05,378
No, no, no. It's okay,
it's okay. I'm a nice guy.

1331
01:24:07,208 --> 01:24:08,618
Okay...

1332
01:24:11,308 --> 01:24:12,718
Who the hell are you?

1333
01:24:12,808 --> 01:24:14,068
I'm Peter Parker.

1334
01:24:14,168 --> 01:24:15,218
That's not possible.

1335
01:24:15,358 --> 01:24:16,638
I am Spider-Man.

1336
01:24:17,568 --> 01:24:20,028
In my world. But
then, yesterday?

1337
01:24:20,598 --> 01:24:21,598
I was...

1338
01:24:23,458 --> 01:24:25,148
I was just here.

1339
01:24:26,148 --> 01:24:27,158
Wow.

1340
01:24:29,548 --> 01:24:31,018
String theory...

1341
01:24:31,268 --> 01:24:33,208
Multidimensional reality...

1342
01:24:34,298 --> 01:24:36,268
And matter displacement.

1343
01:24:36,648 --> 01:24:37,658
All real?

1344
01:24:37,808 --> 01:24:38,808
Yeah...

1345
01:24:38,988 --> 01:24:40,128
Knew it!

1346
01:24:41,378 --> 01:24:43,298
This has to be
because of the spell.

1347
01:24:43,768 --> 01:24:44,878
The spell?

1348
01:24:44,938 --> 01:24:46,668
- Like magic spell?
- There's no spell.

1349
01:24:46,698 --> 01:24:47,458
- No spell.
- No.

1350
01:24:47,488 --> 01:24:48,818
Magic's real here, too?

1351
01:24:48,888 --> 01:24:49,888
- I mean..
- Shut up, Ned.

1352
01:24:49,998 --> 01:24:51,278
No, it's not real.

1353
01:24:51,308 --> 01:24:52,318
- Shut up.
- I mean...

1354
01:24:52,518 --> 01:24:54,238
There's magicians and
stuff, but there's no like...

1355
01:24:54,258 --> 01:24:56,558
Stop it. Stop.

1356
01:24:57,198 --> 01:24:58,518
- Prove it.
- Prove what?

1357
01:24:58,548 --> 01:24:59,658
That you're Peter Parker.

1358
01:24:59,718 --> 01:25:01,808
I don't carry an ID
with me, you know?

1359
01:25:01,828 --> 01:25:04,238
Kinda defeats the whole
anonymous superhero thing?

1360
01:25:06,838 --> 01:25:08,058
Why'd you do that?

1361
01:25:08,108 --> 01:25:09,464
To see if you have
the tingle thing.

1362
01:25:09,488 --> 01:25:11,438
I have the tingle thing,
just not from bread.

1363
01:25:11,508 --> 01:25:15,568
Can you not throw the bread again?
You're a deeply mistrusting person...

1364
01:25:17,238 --> 01:25:18,338
And I respect that.

1365
01:25:24,298 --> 01:25:26,168
- Crawl around.
- Crawl around?

1366
01:25:26,308 --> 01:25:27,798
- Yes.
- No.

1367
01:25:27,818 --> 01:25:29,534
- Crawl around.
- Why do I need to crawl around?

1368
01:25:29,558 --> 01:25:31,154
- Cause it's not enough.
- This is plenty.

1369
01:25:31,178 --> 01:25:32,658
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

1370
01:25:32,688 --> 01:25:34,988
- Nuh-uh.
- How do I stick to the ceiling?

1371
01:25:35,018 --> 01:25:36,058
Do it.

1372
01:25:44,378 --> 01:25:47,208
My Lola's asking if you could
just get the cobweb there.

1373
01:25:47,898 --> 01:25:49,488
- It's too, like, up there?
- Yeah.

1374
01:25:57,968 --> 01:25:59,128
Thank you.

1375
01:26:02,648 --> 01:26:04,058
We're good?

1376
01:26:04,528 --> 01:26:05,528
We're good.

1377
01:26:05,918 --> 01:26:06,928
For now.

1378
01:26:07,598 --> 01:26:10,258
So, I opened a wrong portal
to the wrong Peter Parker.

1379
01:26:10,438 --> 01:26:13,178
Yeah, I guess you just keep
doing it until you find the real one.

1380
01:26:13,208 --> 01:26:14,748
- Ouch.
- No offense.

1381
01:26:15,018 --> 01:26:16,188
- Okay.
- Okay.

1382
01:26:16,278 --> 01:26:17,288
You got it.

1383
01:26:19,378 --> 01:26:20,528
Find Peter Parker.

1384
01:26:20,568 --> 01:26:22,448
What's the thing on his hand?

1385
01:26:22,988 --> 01:26:24,648
Find Peter Parker.

1386
01:26:26,848 --> 01:26:28,508
Find Peter Parker!

1387
01:26:37,418 --> 01:26:39,448
Great, it's just
some random guy.

1388
01:26:39,918 --> 01:26:40,918
Hello.

1389
01:26:41,938 --> 01:26:44,628
I hope it's okay, I just
came through this...

1390
01:26:45,988 --> 01:26:47,168
It just closed.

1391
01:26:48,558 --> 01:26:49,738
You're Peter?

1392
01:26:50,648 --> 01:26:52,848
Yeah. Peter Parker.

1393
01:26:54,958 --> 01:26:56,478
I... I've seen you two...

1394
01:26:59,098 --> 01:27:00,098
Hi.

1395
01:27:04,328 --> 01:27:05,258
Wait. He's...

1396
01:27:05,278 --> 01:27:06,738
He's not your friend...

1397
01:27:22,646 --> 01:27:24,286
Whoa, it's... So you're
Spider-Man too?

1398
01:27:24,346 --> 01:27:25,676
Why didn't you just say that?

1399
01:27:25,716 --> 01:27:28,226
I generally don't go
around advertising it.

1400
01:27:28,446 --> 01:27:30,716
Kinda defeats the whole
anonymous superhero thing.

1401
01:27:30,736 --> 01:27:32,936
- That's what I just said...
- That's what he just said.

1402
01:27:44,856 --> 01:27:47,876
My Lola's asking if you could
clean up the webs that you just shot.

1403
01:27:47,946 --> 01:27:48,956
Oh. Sorry, Lola.

1404
01:27:49,006 --> 01:27:50,046
Yes, of course.

1405
01:27:50,076 --> 01:27:51,226
I'm going to bed.

1406
01:27:51,456 --> 01:27:52,466
Good night, Lola.

1407
01:27:54,316 --> 01:27:57,076
This might seem
kind of weird, but...

1408
01:27:57,176 --> 01:28:00,366
I've been trying to find your
friend ever since I got here.

1409
01:28:01,516 --> 01:28:03,426
I just had this sense that...

1410
01:28:05,316 --> 01:28:06,616
That he needs my help.

1411
01:28:06,686 --> 01:28:07,796
Our help.

1412
01:28:10,156 --> 01:28:11,166
He does.

1413
01:28:11,336 --> 01:28:12,476
We don't know where he is.

1414
01:28:12,586 --> 01:28:13,586
And, umm...

1415
01:28:13,746 --> 01:28:16,656
Honestly, right now,
we're all he really has left.

1416
01:28:18,436 --> 01:28:20,936
Well, is there some place,

1417
01:28:21,536 --> 01:28:25,186
that he might go that
has meaning to him?

1418
01:28:26,926 --> 01:28:27,936
Like a...

1419
01:28:28,476 --> 01:28:30,116
a place where he
would go to just...

1420
01:28:30,246 --> 01:28:31,746
Get away from everything?

1421
01:28:34,946 --> 01:28:37,896
For me, it was the top
of the Chrysler Building.

1422
01:28:38,326 --> 01:28:39,796
Empire State.

1423
01:28:40,546 --> 01:28:41,546
Better view.

1424
01:28:41,586 --> 01:28:42,756
That is a sweet view.

1425
01:28:45,666 --> 01:28:46,676
Yes.

1426
01:28:47,496 --> 01:28:50,236
Yeah, I think I know
exactly where that would be.

1427
01:29:35,356 --> 01:29:36,366
Peter, there's...

1428
01:29:37,866 --> 01:29:40,006
there's some people here...

1429
01:29:40,466 --> 01:29:41,476
Who?

1430
01:29:50,966 --> 01:29:52,596
Hey. Wait, wait, whoa.

1431
01:29:57,456 --> 01:29:58,986
Sorry...

1432
01:29:59,996 --> 01:30:01,706
About May.

1433
01:30:04,816 --> 01:30:07,046
Yeah. Sorry.

1434
01:30:09,416 --> 01:30:10,692
I got some understanding
of what you're going through...

1435
01:30:10,716 --> 01:30:13,156
No, please don't tell me that
you know what I'm going through.

1436
01:30:13,936 --> 01:30:14,936
Okay.

1437
01:30:14,966 --> 01:30:16,636
She's gone.

1438
01:30:19,436 --> 01:30:20,656
It's all my fault.

1439
01:30:24,716 --> 01:30:26,146
She died for nothing.

1440
01:30:29,906 --> 01:30:32,066
So I'm gonna do what I
should've done in the first place.

1441
01:30:32,086 --> 01:30:33,966
- Peter...
- Please, don't.

1442
01:30:35,256 --> 01:30:38,576
You don't belong here. Either
of you, so I'm sending you home.

1443
01:30:40,136 --> 01:30:42,186
Those other guys are
from your worlds, right?

1444
01:30:43,066 --> 01:30:44,196
So you deal with it.

1445
01:30:44,606 --> 01:30:46,226
If they die, if you kill them...

1446
01:30:47,636 --> 01:30:48,906
That's on you.

1447
01:30:49,796 --> 01:30:51,026
It's not my problem.

1448
01:30:51,376 --> 01:30:52,596
I don't care anymore.

1449
01:30:54,056 --> 01:30:55,066
I'm done.

1450
01:30:59,966 --> 01:31:02,146
I'm really sorry that I
dragged you into this.

1451
01:31:05,906 --> 01:31:07,356
But you have to go home now.

1452
01:31:10,086 --> 01:31:11,186
Good luck.

1453
01:31:16,646 --> 01:31:18,346
My Uncle Ben was killed.

1454
01:31:20,026 --> 01:31:21,256
It was my fault.

1455
01:31:22,656 --> 01:31:23,906
I lost...

1456
01:31:26,796 --> 01:31:28,496
I lost Gwen. My...

1457
01:31:30,006 --> 01:31:31,346
She was my MJ.

1458
01:31:33,956 --> 01:31:35,206
I couldn't save her.

1459
01:31:37,226 --> 01:31:39,406
I'm never gonna be able
to forgive myself for that.

1460
01:31:42,406 --> 01:31:44,466
But I carried on. Tried to...

1461
01:31:45,506 --> 01:31:47,716
Tried to keep going.
Tried to keep being the...

1462
01:31:49,526 --> 01:31:51,596
friendly neighborhood
Spider-Man, because

1463
01:31:51,616 --> 01:31:53,082
I know that's what
she would have wanted.

1464
01:31:53,106 --> 01:31:54,106
But...

1465
01:31:54,476 --> 01:31:55,996
At some point, I just...

1466
01:31:56,046 --> 01:31:57,706
I stopped pulling my punches.

1467
01:32:01,706 --> 01:32:02,836
I got rageful.

1468
01:32:05,216 --> 01:32:06,276
I got bitter.

1469
01:32:07,986 --> 01:32:12,196
I just don't want you,
to end up like... Like me.

1470
01:32:13,866 --> 01:32:16,156
The night Ben died,

1471
01:32:17,216 --> 01:32:19,876
I hunted down the
man who I thought did it.

1472
01:32:21,356 --> 01:32:23,046
I wanted him dead.

1473
01:32:25,496 --> 01:32:27,156
I got what I wanted.

1474
01:32:29,496 --> 01:32:31,216
It didn't make it better.

1475
01:32:35,176 --> 01:32:37,466
It took me a long time to...

1476
01:32:39,326 --> 01:32:41,476
learn to get through
that darkness.

1477
01:32:44,316 --> 01:32:45,716
I wanna kill him.

1478
01:32:48,476 --> 01:32:49,826
I wanna tear him apart.

1479
01:32:53,876 --> 01:32:55,886
I can still hear her
voice in my head.

1480
01:33:01,156 --> 01:33:05,286
Even after she was hurt, she said
to me that we did the right thing.

1481
01:33:14,676 --> 01:33:16,686
She told me that
with great power...

1482
01:33:18,076 --> 01:33:20,396
comes great responsibility.

1483
01:33:25,466 --> 01:33:27,186
Wait, what? How
do you know that?

1484
01:33:27,266 --> 01:33:28,776
Uncle Ben said it.

1485
01:33:28,866 --> 01:33:30,226
The day he died.

1486
01:33:34,546 --> 01:33:36,756
Maybe she didn't
die for nothing, Peter.

1487
01:33:46,686 --> 01:33:48,406
Okay, so...

1488
01:33:48,536 --> 01:33:51,126
Connors, Marko, Dillon, and...

1489
01:33:52,746 --> 01:33:56,836
Look, I think that I can repair the devices
for Dillon and Marko, but the others...

1490
01:33:57,366 --> 01:34:00,206
Well, I got Connors. I've already
cured him once, so no big deal.

1491
01:34:01,926 --> 01:34:03,246
What? It's no big deal.

1492
01:34:03,436 --> 01:34:04,456
Great.

1493
01:34:04,996 --> 01:34:06,356
Yeah. That's great.

1494
01:34:09,016 --> 01:34:12,106
I think I can make an
antiserum for Dr. Osborn.

1495
01:34:12,806 --> 01:34:14,656
Been thinking
about it a long time.

1496
01:34:17,916 --> 01:34:19,356
Gotta cure all of them.

1497
01:34:19,556 --> 01:34:20,566
Right?

1498
01:34:21,916 --> 01:34:22,916
Right.

1499
01:34:24,496 --> 01:34:26,006
That's what we do.

1500
01:34:34,256 --> 01:34:35,256
What?

1501
01:34:35,796 --> 01:34:37,546
It's for yous.

1502
01:34:55,516 --> 01:34:56,516
So...

1503
01:34:57,286 --> 01:34:59,046
Do you have a best friend too?

1504
01:35:00,786 --> 01:35:01,796
I did.

1505
01:35:03,906 --> 01:35:05,126
You did?

1506
01:35:06,686 --> 01:35:08,196
He died in my arms.

1507
01:35:10,096 --> 01:35:11,766
After he tried to kill me.

1508
01:35:13,906 --> 01:35:15,206
It was heartbreaking.

1509
01:35:26,086 --> 01:35:27,776
Run a diagnostic.

1510
01:35:28,116 --> 01:35:29,116
Okay.

1511
01:35:38,646 --> 01:35:39,776
Hey, you okay?

1512
01:35:40,726 --> 01:35:42,256
Yeah, I'm fine.

1513
01:35:46,616 --> 01:35:48,056
You don't deserve this.

1514
01:35:49,476 --> 01:35:50,756
I ruined your life...

1515
01:35:50,786 --> 01:35:52,406
Hey. No, no, no, no, no.

1516
01:35:53,576 --> 01:35:55,576
Look at me. I'm here.

1517
01:35:56,906 --> 01:35:58,256
I'm not going anywhere.

1518
01:35:59,646 --> 01:36:02,736
We're gonna get through this.
We're gonna get through it together.

1519
01:36:03,846 --> 01:36:04,846
Okay?

1520
01:36:06,556 --> 01:36:07,566
Okay.

1521
01:36:25,766 --> 01:36:27,156
You have someone?

1522
01:36:28,016 --> 01:36:29,016
No.

1523
01:36:30,346 --> 01:36:33,586
I got no time for
Peter Parker stuff...

1524
01:36:33,736 --> 01:36:34,936
You know?

1525
01:36:36,906 --> 01:36:37,906
Do you?

1526
01:36:38,936 --> 01:36:41,326
It's a little... complicated.

1527
01:36:41,996 --> 01:36:43,146
I understand.

1528
01:36:43,226 --> 01:36:45,436
I guess it's just not in
the cards for guys like us.

1529
01:36:45,706 --> 01:36:46,716
Well...

1530
01:36:47,296 --> 01:36:48,606
I wouldn't give up.

1531
01:36:48,806 --> 01:36:50,156
Took a while, but...

1532
01:36:50,406 --> 01:36:51,656
We made it work.

1533
01:36:51,746 --> 01:36:53,116
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1534
01:36:53,266 --> 01:36:54,376
Me and...

1535
01:36:54,846 --> 01:36:55,876
MJ.

1536
01:36:57,536 --> 01:36:59,176
My MJ. She, uhh...

1537
01:37:00,406 --> 01:37:02,016
It gets confusing, huh?

1538
01:37:04,606 --> 01:37:05,226
Peter?

1539
01:37:05,256 --> 01:37:07,796
- Yeah? Oh, sorry. You mean...
- Yeah? Oh, sorry. You mean...

1540
01:37:08,856 --> 01:37:09,836
Peter-Peter.

1541
01:37:09,866 --> 01:37:11,492
- We're all called Peter, Ned.
- Yeah. Peter?

1542
01:37:11,516 --> 01:37:12,546
Peter Parker?

1543
01:37:12,576 --> 01:37:14,616
- Same.
- We're all Peter Parker.

1544
01:37:14,876 --> 01:37:16,006
The computer!

1545
01:37:17,576 --> 01:37:19,146
- Oh, I'm ready.
- Yeah, me too.

1546
01:37:19,176 --> 01:37:24,096
Okay, so... Now, all we gotta do is
lure these guys someplace, right?

1547
01:37:24,336 --> 01:37:29,216
Try to cure them, while they try
to kill us, and then, send them home.

1548
01:37:29,436 --> 01:37:30,836
Using a magic box?

1549
01:37:30,906 --> 01:37:32,096
Well, that's the plan.

1550
01:37:32,186 --> 01:37:33,862
So are you gonna go
into battle dressed as a

1551
01:37:33,886 --> 01:37:36,296
cool, youth pastor, or
do you got your suit?

1552
01:37:38,476 --> 01:37:39,186
Good.

1553
01:37:39,226 --> 01:37:40,576
Here's your web cartridges.

1554
01:37:40,596 --> 01:37:41,666
Oh, thanks, Ned.

1555
01:37:41,746 --> 01:37:42,936
What's that for?

1556
01:37:43,236 --> 01:37:46,086
It's my web fluid. It's
for my web shooters. Why?

1557
01:37:49,536 --> 01:37:51,176
- That came out of you?
- Yeah.

1558
01:37:51,286 --> 01:37:53,266
- You can't do that, huh?
- No.

1559
01:37:53,296 --> 01:37:54,626
How on Earth is that...

1560
01:37:54,656 --> 01:37:55,826
Anyway, we're getting
sidetracked. Look, this

1561
01:37:55,836 --> 01:37:58,066
is where we're gonna
do this, okay? It's isolated,

1562
01:37:58,086 --> 01:37:59,846
so no one should get hurt.

1563
01:38:00,366 --> 01:38:02,762
We draw them there with the
box, it's the one thing they all want.

1564
01:38:02,786 --> 01:38:04,662
All we have to do is figure
out how we're gonna get there.

1565
01:38:04,686 --> 01:38:06,046
Oh, we can portal there.

1566
01:38:06,066 --> 01:38:07,246
- What?
- I magic now.

1567
01:38:07,316 --> 01:38:08,916
Yeah, no, no. He's
right. He can. He can.

1568
01:38:08,946 --> 01:38:10,276
- Yeah, we saw him.
- Yeah. He is.

1569
01:38:11,016 --> 01:38:13,226
- Wait, really?
- Dude, I got Doctor Strange magic.

1570
01:38:13,266 --> 01:38:14,276
- What?
- Yeah!

1571
01:38:14,936 --> 01:38:16,046
And I promise you...

1572
01:38:16,076 --> 01:38:18,286
I won't turn into a
supervillain and try to kill you.

1573
01:38:20,806 --> 01:38:21,816
Okay...

1574
01:38:22,826 --> 01:38:23,986
Thank you.

1575
01:38:28,846 --> 01:38:29,856
Umm...

1576
01:38:30,226 --> 01:38:32,626
Alright. Here goes nothing.
What's that thing you always say?

1577
01:38:33,226 --> 01:38:34,556
If you expect disappointment...

1578
01:38:34,586 --> 01:38:35,596
No, no, no...

1579
01:38:37,196 --> 01:38:38,396
We're gonna kick some ass.

1580
01:38:39,166 --> 01:38:40,176
Okay.

1581
01:38:40,556 --> 01:38:41,566
Cure.

1582
01:38:41,986 --> 01:38:43,166
Cure some ass.

1583
01:38:43,426 --> 01:38:44,646
Cure that ass.

1584
01:38:47,166 --> 01:38:48,726
Ladies and gentlemen...

1585
01:38:48,746 --> 01:38:50,486
The Bugle tip line
has just received a call

1586
01:38:50,506 --> 01:38:53,926
from none other than the
fugitive known as Spider-Man.

1587
01:38:53,956 --> 01:38:56,516
Fresh from his
rampage in Queens.

1588
01:38:57,296 --> 01:39:01,546
So, Peter Parker... What pernicious
propaganda are you peddling?

1589
01:39:01,606 --> 01:39:03,476
- Just the truth.
- Oh, sure.

1590
01:39:03,546 --> 01:39:04,746
Truth is...

1591
01:39:05,986 --> 01:39:07,796
That this is all my fault.

1592
01:39:07,826 --> 01:39:10,726
I accidentally brought
those dangerous people here.

1593
01:39:10,926 --> 01:39:12,336
Well, he admits it!

1594
01:39:12,506 --> 01:39:14,046
And if those people
are watching...

1595
01:39:16,156 --> 01:39:18,146
Just know that I really
did try to help you.

1596
01:39:19,536 --> 01:39:20,776
I could've killed you.

1597
01:39:22,366 --> 01:39:24,316
At any given
moment, but I didn't.

1598
01:39:26,616 --> 01:39:29,336
Because my Aunt May taught me
that everyone deserves a second chance.

1599
01:39:29,886 --> 01:39:30,946
And that's why I'm here.

1600
01:39:30,976 --> 01:39:32,816
And where is here, exactly?

1601
01:39:34,746 --> 01:39:36,756
A place that represents
second chances.

1602
01:39:39,646 --> 01:39:42,216
The Statue of Liberty?
Good God, folks! He's

1603
01:39:42,246 --> 01:39:45,396
about to destroy
another national landmark.

1604
01:39:45,756 --> 01:39:47,366
The world, if you're watching...

1605
01:39:47,386 --> 01:39:49,056
Believe me, the
world is watching.

1606
01:39:50,246 --> 01:39:51,416
Wish me luck.

1607
01:39:53,236 --> 01:39:55,596
Your friendly neighborhood
Spider-Man could really use some.

1608
01:40:02,036 --> 01:40:04,246
Okay, guys. It could
be any minute now.

1609
01:40:04,396 --> 01:40:06,346
Yup. Almost done.

1610
01:40:11,346 --> 01:40:16,416
You know, Max was like,
the sweetest guy ever.

1611
01:40:16,536 --> 01:40:17,796
Before he fell into a...

1612
01:40:18,806 --> 01:40:20,226
pool of electric eels.

1613
01:40:20,556 --> 01:40:21,566
That'll do it.

1614
01:40:24,206 --> 01:40:25,576
There it goes...

1615
01:40:28,156 --> 01:40:29,356
You okay?

1616
01:40:29,656 --> 01:40:30,716
My back.

1617
01:40:30,786 --> 01:40:33,806
It's kind of stiff from
all the swinging, I guess.

1618
01:40:33,906 --> 01:40:35,656
Oh, yeah, no, I got a
little back pain, too.

1619
01:40:35,696 --> 01:40:36,916
- Really?
- Yeah.

1620
01:40:37,476 --> 01:40:38,886
You want me to crack it?

1621
01:40:39,866 --> 01:40:40,876
Yeah.

1622
01:40:41,146 --> 01:40:42,476
That would be great.

1623
01:40:43,836 --> 01:40:44,536
You ready?

1624
01:40:44,576 --> 01:40:45,576
Yeah.

1625
01:40:49,026 --> 01:40:50,226
That's good.

1626
01:40:51,086 --> 01:40:52,086
How is it?

1627
01:40:52,116 --> 01:40:53,126
Wow.

1628
01:40:54,386 --> 01:40:55,476
- That's good.
- Right?

1629
01:40:55,526 --> 01:40:56,536
- That's better.
- Yeah.

1630
01:40:56,616 --> 01:40:57,626
Wow.

1631
01:41:00,896 --> 01:41:02,356
God, this is so cool.

1632
01:41:02,576 --> 01:41:03,966
I always wanted brothers.

1633
01:41:05,596 --> 01:41:08,586
So you could like make your
own web fluid in your body?

1634
01:41:08,706 --> 01:41:10,446
I'd rather not talk about this.

1635
01:41:10,496 --> 01:41:11,766
No, I don't mean to...

1636
01:41:11,796 --> 01:41:13,272
- Are you teasing me?
- No, no, no. No, no, no.

1637
01:41:13,296 --> 01:41:14,816
He's not teasing
you. It's just that...

1638
01:41:15,576 --> 01:41:19,406
We can't do that, so naturally we're
curious as to how your web situation works.

1639
01:41:19,436 --> 01:41:20,256
That's all.

1640
01:41:20,286 --> 01:41:22,746
If it's personal, I don't
wanna pry. I just think it's cool.

1641
01:41:22,766 --> 01:41:25,806
No. I wish I could tell you,
but it's like, I don't do it...

1642
01:41:25,836 --> 01:41:26,836
Like I don't...

1643
01:41:27,066 --> 01:41:29,636
Like, I don't do breathing.
Like, breathing just happens.

1644
01:41:29,666 --> 01:41:30,276
Whoa.

1645
01:41:30,296 --> 01:41:32,666
Like, does it just come
out of your wrists, or...

1646
01:41:33,126 --> 01:41:34,976
Does it come out
of anywhere else?

1647
01:41:35,036 --> 01:41:36,716
Only... only the wrists.

1648
01:41:36,766 --> 01:41:39,272
You never had a web block?
Cause I run out of webs all the time.

1649
01:41:39,296 --> 01:41:41,186
I had to make my own lab.

1650
01:41:41,476 --> 01:41:43,226
And it's a hassle.

1651
01:41:43,256 --> 01:41:44,966
That sounds like a hassle. Yeah.

1652
01:41:44,986 --> 01:41:47,496
But I did, actually, as
you said that. I was like...

1653
01:41:47,676 --> 01:41:49,476
- I had a web block.
- Why?

1654
01:41:49,736 --> 01:41:51,636
Existential crisis stuff.

1655
01:41:51,656 --> 01:41:53,186
Yeah, don't get me started on that.

1656
01:41:53,206 --> 01:41:54,206
Hey...

1657
01:41:54,446 --> 01:41:57,416
What are like, some of the craziest
villains that you guys have fought?

1658
01:41:57,566 --> 01:41:59,346
Seems you've met some of them.

1659
01:41:59,706 --> 01:42:00,926
That's a good question.

1660
01:42:00,996 --> 01:42:02,056
I fought a...

1661
01:42:02,186 --> 01:42:03,496
an alien...

1662
01:42:03,576 --> 01:42:05,826
made out of black goo once.

1663
01:42:05,896 --> 01:42:07,956
No way! I fought an alien, too.

1664
01:42:08,046 --> 01:42:09,306
On Earth and in space.

1665
01:42:09,346 --> 01:42:10,506
- Oh.
- Yeah. He was purple.

1666
01:42:10,526 --> 01:42:11,646
I wanna fight an alien.

1667
01:42:11,666 --> 01:42:13,206
I'm, I'm still, like...

1668
01:42:13,246 --> 01:42:15,396
That you fought
an alien, in Space.

1669
01:42:16,166 --> 01:42:17,166
I'm lame.

1670
01:42:17,226 --> 01:42:19,126
Like, I fought a
Russian guy in a...

1671
01:42:19,396 --> 01:42:20,976
Like a rhinoceros machine.

1672
01:42:21,006 --> 01:42:23,416
Hey, can we wind it back
to the "I'm lame" part?

1673
01:42:23,436 --> 01:42:24,626
'Cause, you are not.

1674
01:42:24,656 --> 01:42:26,986
Aw, thanks. No, yeah. I appreciate
it, I'm not saying I'm lame.

1675
01:42:27,006 --> 01:42:29,022
But it's just the self-talk
maybe we should, you know...

1676
01:42:29,046 --> 01:42:30,216
- Yeah, listen...
- Please...

1677
01:42:30,236 --> 01:42:32,036
You're... You're Amazing.

1678
01:42:32,226 --> 01:42:33,826
Just to take it in for a minute.

1679
01:42:33,856 --> 01:42:36,366
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- You... You are amazing.

1680
01:42:36,436 --> 01:42:37,722
- I guess I am.
- You are amazing.

1681
01:42:37,746 --> 01:42:39,106
- Thank you.
- Will you say it?

1682
01:42:39,126 --> 01:42:40,856
No, I kinda needed to
hear that. Thank you.

1683
01:42:41,756 --> 01:42:44,176
Alright guys, focus
up. Can you feel that?

1684
01:42:44,226 --> 01:42:45,226
Yeah.

1685
01:42:52,766 --> 01:42:54,036
What's up, Peter?

1686
01:42:56,616 --> 01:42:58,396
How do you like the new news?

1687
01:42:59,416 --> 01:43:03,606
Look, you give it to
me, I'm gonna destroy it.

1688
01:43:04,136 --> 01:43:06,026
But I'll let you live.

1689
01:43:06,616 --> 01:43:08,796
Don't make me a murderer, Peter.

1690
01:43:11,026 --> 01:43:12,766
Okay, guys. Here it comes.

1691
01:43:19,206 --> 01:43:20,446
Hey, Max!

1692
01:43:20,656 --> 01:43:22,146
I missed you, man!

1693
01:43:24,796 --> 01:43:26,606
All right, MJ, heads up!

1694
01:43:27,636 --> 01:43:29,056
Got it! Close it.

1695
01:43:32,986 --> 01:43:34,866
- Okay...
- I know.

1696
01:43:34,906 --> 01:43:36,602
- Why isn't it closing?
- I don't know... I...

1697
01:43:36,626 --> 01:43:38,156
Have you closed before? No?

1698
01:43:38,186 --> 01:43:40,316
No. I mean I have opened some.

1699
01:43:48,386 --> 01:43:51,606
Max, Max, Max. Can we just talk
for a second? Just you and me, just...

1700
01:43:51,816 --> 01:43:55,076
Look who showed up!
Our old friend Spider-Man.

1701
01:43:55,256 --> 01:43:57,322
I'm trying to save you, Max.
That's all I've ever wanted.

1702
01:43:57,346 --> 01:43:59,076
- You're not trying to save me.
- I am.

1703
01:43:59,126 --> 01:44:01,046
You ain't even shit no more.

1704
01:44:01,526 --> 01:44:04,646
Don't worry about
me. I'll save myself.

1705
01:44:07,706 --> 01:44:09,646
I got his attention, now what?

1706
01:44:09,666 --> 01:44:11,296
Open the cage!

1707
01:44:11,906 --> 01:44:14,586
Just FYI, Lizard-guy
is here too.

1708
01:44:16,176 --> 01:44:18,016
Guys, comm check, hello.

1709
01:44:18,836 --> 01:44:20,226
I need Max's cure.

1710
01:44:20,296 --> 01:44:21,806
Yeah. I'm on it.

1711
01:44:22,296 --> 01:44:24,246
Peter! I need the Lizard cure.

1712
01:44:24,336 --> 01:44:25,806
Okay! Okay!

1713
01:44:31,136 --> 01:44:32,686
Where's the box, Peter?

1714
01:44:32,796 --> 01:44:35,296
- Flint! We can help everyone.
- I don't care!

1715
01:44:47,116 --> 01:44:48,146
Sorry!

1716
01:44:50,266 --> 01:44:53,326
I tried to tell you, Sandman.
Nobody's going home.

1717
01:45:31,936 --> 01:45:34,296
What the hell, is
going on out there?

1718
01:45:34,336 --> 01:45:36,046
I kept yelling at you,
Peter 2, Peter 2...

1719
01:45:36,066 --> 01:45:37,786
I know, but I thought
you're Peter 2?

1720
01:45:37,816 --> 01:45:39,216
What? I'm not Peter...

1721
01:45:39,266 --> 01:45:41,026
Stop arguing, both of
you! Listen to Peter 1.

1722
01:45:41,156 --> 01:45:43,206
Look, we're clearly
not very good at this!

1723
01:45:43,236 --> 01:45:44,686
I know, I know. We suck.

1724
01:45:44,716 --> 01:45:46,636
I, I don't know how
to work as a team.

1725
01:45:46,656 --> 01:45:47,626
Me neither.

1726
01:45:47,676 --> 01:45:49,556
Well I do. I have
been in a team, okay?

1727
01:45:49,586 --> 01:45:51,316
I don't wanna brag, but I will.

1728
01:45:51,366 --> 01:45:53,116
- I was in the Avengers.
- The Avengers?

1729
01:45:53,176 --> 01:45:54,486
- Yeah.
- That's great!

1730
01:45:54,516 --> 01:45:56,396
- Thank you.
- What is that?

1731
01:45:56,886 --> 01:45:58,426
Wait, you don't
have the Avengers?

1732
01:45:58,496 --> 01:46:00,006
Is that a band?
Are you in a band?

1733
01:46:00,086 --> 01:46:02,246
No, I'm not in a band.
No, the Avengers is a...

1734
01:46:02,326 --> 01:46:04,106
- Earth's Mightiest...
- How is this helping?!

1735
01:46:04,126 --> 01:46:07,266
Look, it's not important. All we
gotta do is focus, trust your tingle,

1736
01:46:07,296 --> 01:46:08,836
and coordinate our attacks, okay?

1737
01:46:08,866 --> 01:46:11,546
Yes. Okay. Let's
pick one target.

1738
01:46:11,566 --> 01:46:12,366
Right.

1739
01:46:12,396 --> 01:46:13,992
We take them off the
board one at a time.

1740
01:46:14,016 --> 01:46:15,166
Now you got it. Okay...

1741
01:46:15,186 --> 01:46:16,446
- Peter 1, Peter 2...
- Peter 2.

1742
01:46:16,496 --> 01:46:17,646
- Peter 3.
- Peter 3!

1743
01:46:17,676 --> 01:46:19,996
- All right, let's do this...
- No, wait, wait, wait, wait!

1744
01:46:20,616 --> 01:46:22,116
I love you guys.

1745
01:46:24,586 --> 01:46:25,756
Thank you.

1746
01:46:27,396 --> 01:46:28,966
- All right. Let's do this.
- Let's go.

1747
01:46:58,826 --> 01:47:00,126
Okay, Spider-Man.

1748
01:47:00,786 --> 01:47:01,996
Sandman first.

1749
01:47:03,576 --> 01:47:05,236
I'm gonna lead him
inside the statue.

1750
01:47:05,396 --> 01:47:06,726
I'll meet you at the top.

1751
01:47:13,906 --> 01:47:16,906
- Hey, Dr. Connors.
- Hello, Peter.

1752
01:47:18,236 --> 01:47:19,316
Peter 1!

1753
01:47:19,846 --> 01:47:20,846
I got it.

1754
01:47:32,076 --> 01:47:34,436
Flint! We're trying to help you!

1755
01:47:36,316 --> 01:47:37,716
Guys, I'm at the top!

1756
01:47:38,496 --> 01:47:39,876
I need the cure!

1757
01:47:42,076 --> 01:47:43,685
I'm coming, I'm
coming, I'm coming!

1758
01:47:43,686 --> 01:47:49,335
Just wait your turn!

1759
01:47:49,336 --> 01:47:50,716
I'll be right back.

1760
01:48:27,826 --> 01:48:29,276
It's okay, Flint.

1761
01:48:31,126 --> 01:48:32,746
We're gonna get you home.

1762
01:48:33,556 --> 01:48:36,176
Just... stay right here.

1763
01:48:40,906 --> 01:48:42,922
How do we stop him? I've
never seen him this powerful.

1764
01:48:42,946 --> 01:48:45,046
It's the arc reactor.
We gotta get it off him.

1765
01:48:45,226 --> 01:48:47,076
You're not gonna
take this away from me.

1766
01:48:49,716 --> 01:48:51,046
That's not gonna work.

1767
01:48:56,076 --> 01:48:57,786
Okay, we've gotta
do this up close.

1768
01:48:57,886 --> 01:49:00,776
Peter 2 go right,
Peter 3 go left. On me.

1769
01:49:31,096 --> 01:49:34,266
All right, we're fine. We're gonna do
it again. We're just gonna keep trying.

1770
01:49:34,296 --> 01:49:36,336
Alright. We got it.
I got it. Got this.

1771
01:49:36,396 --> 01:49:37,976
Close the portal.

1772
01:49:40,836 --> 01:49:42,376
Oh, no. No, no, no!

1773
01:49:42,506 --> 01:49:44,916
Ned, that is a lizard,
and we should...

1774
01:49:49,616 --> 01:49:50,616
Run!

1775
01:49:54,016 --> 01:49:55,556
Connors, stop!

1776
01:50:04,546 --> 01:50:05,546
Yeah.

1777
01:50:17,976 --> 01:50:20,416
Leave them. They're mine.

1778
01:50:20,936 --> 01:50:23,576
I don't need your
help. I got it just fine.

1779
01:50:23,826 --> 01:50:25,866
Dr. Octavius. No.

1780
01:50:28,046 --> 01:50:29,516
What are you doing?

1781
01:50:30,966 --> 01:50:32,226
Get it off me!

1782
01:50:43,636 --> 01:50:44,806
There you go.

1783
01:51:03,866 --> 01:51:05,056
MJ!

1784
01:51:16,806 --> 01:51:18,926
- We need help with this thing.
- Right, right, right.

1785
01:51:28,046 --> 01:51:29,516
Where is he?

1786
01:51:30,356 --> 01:51:30,946
Wait, wait, wait!

1787
01:51:30,976 --> 01:51:33,586
Before you do anything,
Mister... Doctor Strange, sir, well...

1788
01:51:33,796 --> 01:51:34,936
Peter's plan is working.

1789
01:51:35,246 --> 01:51:36,996
- What plan?
- He's curing them.

1790
01:51:45,976 --> 01:51:47,106
Dr. Connors?

1791
01:51:50,326 --> 01:51:51,506
Welcome back, sir.

1792
01:51:53,456 --> 01:51:54,846
Well, I'll be damned.

1793
01:51:57,656 --> 01:51:59,396
Did you just open a portal?

1794
01:52:00,396 --> 01:52:01,586
Yes, yes, sir. I did.

1795
01:52:09,696 --> 01:52:10,696
Max.

1796
01:52:11,796 --> 01:52:12,796
Max...

1797
01:52:13,236 --> 01:52:14,246
Don't worry.

1798
01:52:14,546 --> 01:52:16,796
- I'm all tapped out.
- You sure about that?

1799
01:52:18,236 --> 01:52:19,676
I'm back to being a nobody.

1800
01:52:19,946 --> 01:52:22,976
- You were never a nobody, Max.
- Yes, I was. Yes, I was.

1801
01:52:23,526 --> 01:52:24,536
You don't see me.

1802
01:52:26,196 --> 01:52:27,526
Can I tell you something?

1803
01:52:28,206 --> 01:52:29,206
Yeah.

1804
01:52:29,886 --> 01:52:32,026
You got a nice face.
You're just a kid.

1805
01:52:32,546 --> 01:52:34,046
You're from Queens...

1806
01:52:35,186 --> 01:52:36,516
You got that suit...

1807
01:52:36,626 --> 01:52:38,066
You help a lot of poor people...

1808
01:52:38,706 --> 01:52:40,276
I just thought you
was gonna be black.

1809
01:52:41,906 --> 01:52:43,146
Oh, man. I'm sorry.

1810
01:52:43,476 --> 01:52:46,426
Don't mind it. There's gotta be a
black Spider-Man somehwere out there.

1811
01:52:50,336 --> 01:52:51,716
Goddamn eels.

1812
01:52:55,096 --> 01:52:56,676
The power of the sun...

1813
01:52:59,766 --> 01:53:01,686
in the palm of your hand.

1814
01:53:01,936 --> 01:53:03,036
Peter?

1815
01:53:05,026 --> 01:53:06,066
Otto.

1816
01:53:07,836 --> 01:53:09,796
Oh, it's good to
see you, dear boy.

1817
01:53:10,616 --> 01:53:12,386
It's good to see you.

1818
01:53:12,516 --> 01:53:14,166
You're all grown up.

1819
01:53:15,086 --> 01:53:16,586
How are you?

1820
01:53:18,826 --> 01:53:20,236
Trying to do better.

1821
01:53:27,416 --> 01:53:28,815
Strange, we're so close...

1822
01:53:28,816 --> 01:53:29,756
Skip it!

1823
01:53:29,757 --> 01:53:32,426
I've been dangling over the
Grand Canyon for twelve hours!

1824
01:53:32,446 --> 01:53:34,536
I know. I know, I
know, I know. I...

1825
01:53:35,796 --> 01:53:37,756
I'm sorry about
that, sir. I mean...

1826
01:53:38,516 --> 01:53:39,936
You went to the Grand Canyon?

1827
01:53:40,286 --> 01:53:42,282
- He could've used your help.
- No, no. It's okay, it's okay.

1828
01:53:42,306 --> 01:53:43,976
These are my new
friends. This is Peter Parker,

1829
01:53:43,996 --> 01:53:45,726
he's Peter Parker.
Spider-Man, Spider-Man.

1830
01:53:45,756 --> 01:53:48,296
They're mes from other
universes. They're here to help.

1831
01:53:48,476 --> 01:53:50,102
This is the wizard that
I was telling you about.

1832
01:53:50,126 --> 01:53:53,896
Look, I am really impressed that you managed
to give them all a second chance, kid.

1833
01:53:55,016 --> 01:53:57,016
But this has to end, now.

1834
01:53:57,086 --> 01:54:00,356
Can the Spider-Man
come out to play?

1835
01:54:22,656 --> 01:54:23,656
Strange, no!

1836
01:54:53,886 --> 01:54:55,346
Are you okay?

1837
01:54:55,966 --> 01:54:58,366
Yeah. I'm okay.

1838
01:55:00,756 --> 01:55:02,846
Are you okay?

1839
01:56:18,856 --> 01:56:20,546
Thank you, Mister Cape, sir.

1840
01:56:23,936 --> 01:56:24,936
Ned!

1841
01:56:31,806 --> 01:56:33,146
MJ!

1842
01:56:33,306 --> 01:56:34,306
Peter?

1843
01:56:34,826 --> 01:56:36,205
- Ned!
- Peter?

1844
01:56:36,206 --> 01:56:37,246
Hey.

1845
01:56:37,666 --> 01:56:39,946
- Are you okay?
- We're okay.

1846
01:56:54,326 --> 01:56:55,807
Poor Peter.

1847
01:56:56,236 --> 01:56:59,726
Too weak to send me home to die.

1848
01:57:01,566 --> 01:57:03,356
I just wanna kill you myself.

1849
01:57:04,530 --> 01:57:06,161
Attaboy.

1850
01:58:55,967 --> 01:58:57,547
She was there.

1851
01:58:58,027 --> 01:58:59,987
Because of you...

1852
01:59:00,177 --> 01:59:03,057
I may have struck the blow.

1853
01:59:03,287 --> 01:59:05,457
But you?

1854
01:59:07,977 --> 01:59:11,717
You are the one that killed her.

1855
01:59:38,565 --> 01:59:39,565
Peter?

1856
01:59:52,967 --> 01:59:54,297
What have I done?

1857
01:59:58,387 --> 02:00:00,747
- It's you.
- You okay?

1858
02:00:01,057 --> 02:00:03,807
Yeah, I'm good. I've
been stabbed before.

1859
02:00:03,857 --> 02:00:05,057
Hey.

1860
02:00:06,217 --> 02:00:07,877
Hey, nice catch.

1861
02:00:08,207 --> 02:00:09,577
Nice throw.

1862
02:00:13,204 --> 02:00:15,196
Is that happening? Or am I dying?

1863
02:00:15,221 --> 02:00:16,825
Yeah, no, that's happening.
That's real.

1864
02:00:16,850 --> 02:00:18,520
Are there people in the sky?

1865
02:00:26,776 --> 02:00:28,286
- I gotta go.
- Yeah. Yeah, I got him.

1866
02:00:33,579 --> 02:00:34,939
What's happening?

1867
02:00:34,979 --> 02:00:37,025
They're starting to come
through and I can't stop them.

1868
02:00:37,049 --> 02:00:40,179
There's got to be something we can
do. Can't you just cast a spell again?

1869
02:00:40,209 --> 02:00:41,925
Like the original way.
Before I screwed it up.

1870
02:00:41,949 --> 02:00:43,619
We're too late for
that. They're here.

1871
02:00:45,569 --> 02:00:47,129
They're here because of you.

1872
02:00:52,419 --> 02:00:54,059
What if everyone
forgot who I was?

1873
02:00:54,179 --> 02:00:55,179
What?

1874
02:00:55,549 --> 02:00:57,005
They're coming here
because of me, right?

1875
02:00:57,029 --> 02:01:00,149
Because I'm Peter
Parker? So cast a new spell.

1876
02:01:00,309 --> 02:01:02,529
But this time, make everyone
forget who Peter Parker is.

1877
02:01:02,549 --> 02:01:04,279
Make everyone forget...

1878
02:01:05,923 --> 02:01:06,443
Me.

1879
02:01:06,553 --> 02:01:07,153
No.

1880
02:01:07,413 --> 02:01:08,673
But it would work, right?

1881
02:01:08,833 --> 02:01:09,843
Yeah, it would work.

1882
02:01:11,523 --> 02:01:15,843
But you got to understand, that would
mean everyone, who knows and loves you

1883
02:01:16,033 --> 02:01:17,033
We'd...

1884
02:01:18,767 --> 02:01:20,637
We'd have no memory of you.

1885
02:01:22,750 --> 02:01:24,590
It'll be as though
you never existed.

1886
02:01:28,059 --> 02:01:29,059
I know.

1887
02:01:31,393 --> 02:01:32,393
Do it.

1888
02:01:35,954 --> 02:01:38,375
Then go and say your
goodbyes. You don't have long.

1889
02:01:38,977 --> 02:01:39,977
Thank you, sir.

1890
02:01:40,283 --> 02:01:41,673
Call me Stephen.

1891
02:01:44,868 --> 02:01:46,128
Thank you, Stephen.

1892
02:01:47,888 --> 02:01:48,888
Yeah...

1893
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:50,535
Still feels weird.

1894
02:01:53,344 --> 02:01:54,424
I'll see you around.

1895
02:01:56,544 --> 02:01:57,554
So long, kid.

1896
02:02:07,174 --> 02:02:09,224
I think this is it. I think
you're about to go home.

1897
02:02:09,944 --> 02:02:12,334
But I... uhh...

1898
02:02:14,794 --> 02:02:15,794
Thank you.

1899
02:02:16,844 --> 02:02:17,994
I just wanted...

1900
02:02:18,144 --> 02:02:19,684
I wanna tell you that...

1901
02:02:20,444 --> 02:02:22,234
I really don't know
how to say this, like...

1902
02:02:22,484 --> 02:02:23,004
Peter.

1903
02:02:23,034 --> 02:02:24,244
I want you to know that I...

1904
02:02:26,024 --> 02:02:27,024
We know.

1905
02:02:27,764 --> 02:02:28,854
It's what we do.

1906
02:02:30,518 --> 02:02:31,808
Yeah. It's what we do.

1907
02:02:33,264 --> 02:02:35,214
Right. I gotta find Ned and MJ.

1908
02:02:37,344 --> 02:02:39,884
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you!

1909
02:02:43,404 --> 02:02:44,834
I guess I'll see you.

1910
02:02:45,334 --> 02:02:46,904
- Keep safe.
- Bye.

1911
02:02:50,276 --> 02:02:51,736
You're in so much pain, huh?

1912
02:02:51,761 --> 02:02:52,831
- I am.
- Yeah.

1913
02:03:02,454 --> 02:03:03,324
Are you okay?

1914
02:03:03,354 --> 02:03:04,354
Yeah, we're okay.

1915
02:03:04,914 --> 02:03:05,930
Oh, my God. You're bleeding.

1916
02:03:05,954 --> 02:03:07,804
- No. I'm okay.
- Are you sure?

1917
02:03:07,824 --> 02:03:09,644
I'm fine. I promise.

1918
02:03:13,364 --> 02:03:15,244
We should go, right?

1919
02:03:18,802 --> 02:03:20,332
You're gonna forget who I am.

1920
02:03:22,652 --> 02:03:24,922
- What?
- Peter, what are you talking about?

1921
02:03:26,372 --> 02:03:27,372
It's okay...

1922
02:03:27,742 --> 02:03:29,050
I'm gonna come and find you,

1923
02:03:29,550 --> 02:03:31,010
and I'll explain everything.

1924
02:03:33,202 --> 02:03:34,644
I'll make you remember me.

1925
02:03:35,441 --> 02:03:37,512
It'll be like none of
this ever happened.

1926
02:03:37,907 --> 02:03:38,597
Okay?

1927
02:03:38,737 --> 02:03:40,417
But what if that doesn't work?

1928
02:03:40,517 --> 02:03:43,377
What if that doesn't work,
what if we can't remember you?

1929
02:03:43,397 --> 02:03:44,447
I don't wanna do that.

1930
02:03:45,087 --> 02:03:46,707
I don't wanna do that.

1931
02:03:46,747 --> 02:03:47,747
I know. MJ, I know.

1932
02:03:48,547 --> 02:03:49,893
There's gotta be
something we can do.

1933
02:03:49,917 --> 02:03:53,197
We can come up with like a plan or something?
There's gotta be something we can do.

1934
02:03:55,106 --> 02:03:56,516
There's nothing we can do.

1935
02:04:00,827 --> 02:04:01,907
But we'll be okay.

1936
02:04:06,548 --> 02:04:07,548
Promise?

1937
02:04:10,088 --> 02:04:11,578
Yeah, I promise.

1938
02:04:23,563 --> 02:04:24,843
I'll come find you. Okay?

1939
02:04:25,890 --> 02:04:26,890
I know you will.

1940
02:04:31,627 --> 02:04:32,677
You better.

1941
02:04:34,625 --> 02:04:36,535
If you don't, i'm just gonna figure it out.

1942
02:04:37,381 --> 02:04:39,121
I've done it before, i can do it again.

1943
02:04:40,477 --> 02:04:42,137
I promise I'll fix this.

1944
02:04:43,277 --> 02:04:44,367
I really hate magic.

1945
02:04:46,207 --> 02:04:47,207
Yeah. Me, too.

1946
02:04:52,210 --> 02:04:53,210
I love you.

1947
02:04:59,585 --> 02:05:00,995
- I love you...
- Just wait

1948
02:05:02,055 --> 02:05:04,495
Wait, and tell me
when you see me again.

1949
02:07:15,195 --> 02:07:17,985
It's been a few weeks since the
fiasco on the Statue of Liberty,

1950
02:07:18,020 --> 02:07:21,255
and Spider-Man's cultists
continue to contend

1951
02:07:21,280 --> 02:07:23,684
that the vile
vigilante is a hero.

1952
02:07:24,655 --> 02:07:28,585
But if he were a hero, he'd unmask
himself and tell us who he really is.

1953
02:07:28,775 --> 02:07:31,855
Because only a coward
conceals his identity.

1954
02:07:32,335 --> 02:07:35,295
Only a coward hides
his true intentions.

1955
02:07:35,950 --> 02:07:39,732
Rest assured, ladies and gentlemen,
that this reporter will uncover those...

1956
02:07:42,107 --> 02:07:43,107
Hi.

1957
02:07:43,271 --> 02:07:45,891
My name is Peter Parker.
You don't know me, but I...

1958
02:07:48,461 --> 02:07:51,121
My name is Peter Parker
and you don't know me, but...

1959
02:07:54,480 --> 02:07:55,480
Okay...

1960
02:07:58,198 --> 02:08:00,178
- No way.
- Hard to believe, isn't it?

1961
02:08:09,831 --> 02:08:10,831
Hey.

1962
02:08:16,530 --> 02:08:17,130
One sec.

1963
02:08:17,391 --> 02:08:18,791
Can I help you?

1964
02:08:19,181 --> 02:08:20,281
Hi. Umm...

1965
02:08:20,461 --> 02:08:21,901
My name is Peter Parker.

1966
02:08:22,031 --> 02:08:23,391
And I...

1967
02:08:26,661 --> 02:08:29,321
would like a coffee. Please.

1968
02:08:30,158 --> 02:08:32,658
Okay, no problem, Peter Parker.

1969
02:08:39,224 --> 02:08:42,044
Donuts for my fellow engineer.

1970
02:08:42,624 --> 02:08:45,356
- Wait, what?
- MIT, they have the engineers. The mascot.

1971
02:08:45,464 --> 02:08:47,714
Oh, right, right, right.
I should probably know that.

1972
02:08:47,755 --> 02:08:49,724
Look at you with
the school spirit.

1973
02:08:50,292 --> 02:08:51,982
Tell anybody, i will deny it.

1974
02:09:03,576 --> 02:09:04,596
Peter Parker?

1975
02:09:05,106 --> 02:09:06,106
Peter Parker?

1976
02:09:06,646 --> 02:09:07,776
Your coffee.

1977
02:09:07,816 --> 02:09:08,976
Right. Thank you.

1978
02:09:11,983 --> 02:09:13,823
Are you excited for MIT?

1979
02:09:16,268 --> 02:09:17,578
Right. Yeah.

1980
02:09:18,536 --> 02:09:20,546
Yeah, actually I am
excited, which is weird

1981
02:09:20,576 --> 02:09:22,206
because I don't really
get excited about things.

1982
02:09:22,216 --> 02:09:24,630
I kind of expect disappointment.

1983
02:09:24,975 --> 02:09:27,065
'Cause then you'd never
actually be disappointed.

1984
02:09:28,017 --> 02:09:29,017
Right?

1985
02:09:32,028 --> 02:09:33,588
Yeah. Right.

1986
02:09:35,185 --> 02:09:36,225
It's just... I don't know...

1987
02:09:36,245 --> 02:09:38,495
It just kinda feels different
this time for some reason.

1988
02:09:52,722 --> 02:09:53,722
That was...

1989
02:10:03,447 --> 02:10:04,447
You okay?

1990
02:10:05,447 --> 02:10:07,017
Doesn't really hurt anymore.

1991
02:10:18,500 --> 02:10:20,305
Is there anything else?

1992
02:10:32,730 --> 02:10:33,730
No.

1993
02:10:37,767 --> 02:10:38,787
Thank you.

1994
02:10:39,767 --> 02:10:41,047
No problem.

1995
02:10:47,187 --> 02:10:49,017
See you around.

1996
02:11:53,585 --> 02:11:55,005
How do you know her?

1997
02:11:58,703 --> 02:12:00,473
Through Spider-Man.

1998
02:12:01,016 --> 02:12:02,996
- You?
- Same.

1999
02:12:08,473 --> 02:12:10,967
I lost a good friend a while back.

2000
02:12:11,323 --> 02:12:12,383
It felt like this.

2001
02:12:15,213 --> 02:12:16,193
It hurts 'cause they're gone,

2002
02:12:16,203 --> 02:12:19,079
and then it hurts all over again because
you remember what they stood for,

2003
02:12:19,103 --> 02:12:20,333
and you wonder...

2004
02:12:21,044 --> 02:12:22,784
Is all that gone too?

2005
02:12:27,157 --> 02:12:28,657
No, it's not gone.

2006
02:12:31,569 --> 02:12:33,209
Everybody she helped...

2007
02:12:35,572 --> 02:12:36,722
they'll keep it going.

2008
02:12:38,031 --> 02:12:39,301
You really think so?

2009
02:12:40,617 --> 02:12:41,617
I know it.

2010
02:12:43,815 --> 02:12:45,258
Take care of yourself, okay?

2011
02:12:45,283 --> 02:12:47,293
Yeah. Nice to meet you.

2012
02:12:54,699 --> 02:12:56,477
Rent is due on the first of the month.

2013
02:12:57,157 --> 02:12:58,329
Don't be late.

2014
02:13:49,242 --> 02:13:51,266
4-3 Edward, do you need EMS assist?

2015
02:13:51,291 --> 02:13:54,555
Negative, Central.
We're gonna need a car tow.

2016
02:17:11,555 --> 02:17:12,125
Okay...

2017
02:17:12,150 --> 02:17:16,270
Okay, I think I got this. You're
saying that this whole place...

2018
02:17:16,282 --> 02:17:18,912
here. It's just tons of...

2019
02:17:19,842 --> 02:17:20,922
Superpeople.

2020
02:17:20,942 --> 02:17:24,012
And he has been
saying it for hours.

2021
02:17:24,752 --> 02:17:27,972
All right, tell me again.
I'm sorry. I'm an idiot.

2022
02:17:28,042 --> 02:17:32,122
There was a billionaire. He had
a tin suit, and he could fly. Right?

2023
02:17:34,243 --> 02:17:37,253
Okay. And there was a
really angry green man.

2024
02:17:37,723 --> 02:17:39,103
- Hulk.
- Hulk.

2025
02:17:39,143 --> 02:17:41,643
And you thought Lethal
Protector was a shit name.

2026
02:17:41,663 --> 02:17:43,493
Yeah, because it is.

2027
02:17:43,513 --> 02:17:47,963
Now, tell me again about your
purple alien that loves stones.

2028
02:17:48,083 --> 02:17:50,803
'Cause I'll tell you what, man.
Aliens, they do not love stones.

2029
02:17:50,823 --> 02:17:52,483
Eddie, don't start!

2030
02:17:52,513 --> 02:17:54,783
You know what aliens
love? Eating brains!

2031
02:17:54,833 --> 02:17:57,123
Because that's what
they do. All right?

2032
02:17:57,283 --> 02:17:59,983
Senor, he made
my family disappear.

2033
02:18:01,313 --> 02:18:02,313
For five years.

2034
02:18:03,683 --> 02:18:04,783
Five years?

2035
02:18:06,803 --> 02:18:08,173
That's a long time.

2036
02:18:10,773 --> 02:18:14,843
I mean, maybe I should go
to New York and speak to this,

2037
02:18:16,523 --> 02:18:17,523
Spider-Man.

2038
02:18:17,743 --> 02:18:20,513
Eddie! We are drunk!

2039
02:18:22,363 --> 02:18:25,183
- Let's go skinny-dip!
- I don't think we should skinny-dip.

2040
02:18:25,203 --> 02:18:26,443
Sir, you have to pay your bill.

2041
02:18:26,493 --> 02:18:31,003
What is happening? No! We
just got here. No, not again!

2042
02:18:35,182 --> 02:18:36,652
And there he goes.

2043
02:18:37,151 --> 02:18:39,881
Without paying the
bill, no tips, nothing.
