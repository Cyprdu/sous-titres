1
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,537
Get back, you lot!

2
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,181
Get to the guillotine!

3
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,916
The scourge of France!

4
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,489
Terror is nothing more than justice.

5
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:43,700
Prompt, severe, inflexible.

6
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:49,706
It is therefore an emanation of virtue.

7
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,753
Now, she was guilty
of three charges against you.

8
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:58,215
Depletion of the national treasury...

9
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:04,429
conspiracy against the internal
and external security of State...

10
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:10,519
and high treason for acting
in the interests of the enemy.

11
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,941
Mercy for the villains?

12
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:19,403
No.

13
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,073
Mercy for the innocent.

14
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:26,201
Mercy for the unfortunate.

15
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:28,620
Mercy for humanity.

16
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,962
An inescapable outcome
of democracy's connection

17
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:40,966
in relation to the nation's
immediate demands at this moment...

18
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:44,011
The British navy have taken
the port of Toulon.

19
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,305
Half the French fleet is trapped there.

20
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:49,600
If we lose those ships,
the Republic will fall.

21
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:54,313
Lucky for us, there are only
2000 English troops in Toulon.

22
00:05:55,147 --> 00:06:01,653
But we are short of artillery and led by
a general who was a court painter.

23
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,324
It is not necessary
to recapture Toulon itself.

24
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:09,411
The town is not a town.
The town is a port.

25
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:12,998
If the harbor's untenable
to the English fleet,

26
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,833
the town must surrender.

27
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:18,504
My brother, Captain Bonaparte,
as artillery officer,

28
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:22,799
has organized heated shots
against English ships.

29
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:26,345
He has proven
his commitment to the Republic.

30
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,765
And how do you propose to take the harbor?

31
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:33,101
Capture the fort that dominates the harbor

32
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:35,020
and you have the city.

33
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,987
We must make an example,
or other cities will fall.

34
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:46,949
And I, for one,

35
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:51,662
will never let the royalists
or the English take my region.

36
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,551
Morning, sir.

37
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:08,262
General Carteaux?

38
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:10,597
He's over there.

39
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:20,649
Lucien, my dear brother,
I am in Toulon already.

40
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,861
The troops are in a poor state,

41
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,781
and your conscripts untrained
and undisciplined.

42
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:32,327
Without equipment and resources,
I see only failure.

43
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:51,471
We are collecting scrap iron to recast
small mortars more suitable for my plan.

44
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:53,807
If we do not succeed,

45
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:57,269
those in power will only see us
as Corsican ruffians

46
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:59,271
unfit for higher office,

47
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:01,815
and our mother's ambitions
will be quashed.

48
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:17,581
That's it, madame. Fine eye you have.

49
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:20,792
-There you go.
-Reckon I'll still be here next week.

50
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:28,467
The British control the big guns
that point out at their fleet offshore.

51
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:33,722
Take those guns, and we can fire
onto them and end this blockade.

52
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:51,156
Surprise is my advantage,
but I will win by fire.

53
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:53,784
I cannot wait for your arrival.

54
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,203
Your brother, Napoleon.

55
00:08:57,412 --> 00:09:00,791
Oi, shit rag! Yes, you!

56
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:08,173
Move along now. Go on. Move!

57
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:13,178
Move them fucking goats!

58
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:18,058
Last chance! Fucking move them goats!

59
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:22,896
Fucking move them now!

60
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,877
He sat himself down by the fire, my boys

61
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,963
To join in our jovial crew

62
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,382
-Get in position.
-Quick!

63
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:55,429
By the chimney corner was his own place

64
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:59,183
Where he could sit and dye his old face

65
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,226
When Jones's ale was new, my boys

66
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,477
Quick, quick!

67
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:06,481
When Jones's ale was new

68
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:12,821
Pints of beer and bottles of sherry
To help them over the hill so merry

69
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:17,451
When Jones's ale was new

70
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:09,753
Fire!

71
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:19,805
We're under attack!

72
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:21,223
Grab your weapons!

73
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,394
Get those ladders up quick, men!

74
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:40,909
Fire! Hit your target!

75
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:44,913
Get the mortars up there!

76
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:56,550
Ready, boy. Ready, boy. Ready, boy.

77
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:01,263
Oh, God!

78
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:11,773
-You all right?
-I'm fine.

79
00:12:59,238 --> 00:13:00,697
Set the mortars!

80
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:12,501
Protect the cannons!

81
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:16,839
Into position!

82
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:25,347
-Vive la France!
-Vive la France!

83
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,577
Ready the cannons!

84
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,078
Sir! Yes, sir.

85
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,080
Mortars!

86
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:53,750
Elevation 1-6-0.

87
00:13:57,171 --> 00:13:59,339
-Fire!
-Firing!

88
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:04,595
Junot, heated shots!

89
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,930
Fire!

90
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,154
Junot, fire!

91
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:23,822
Fire!

92
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:40,380
-Reload!
-Reload.

93
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,303
Fire!

94
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,805
Fire!

95
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:07,115
Shoulder arms!

96
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:12,829
Captain Napoleon Bonaparte,
I award you the rank of brigadier general.

97
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,627
Long live the Republic!

98
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,504
Long live the Republic!

99
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:24,633
Long live the Republic!
Long live the Republic!

100
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:33,392
I promised you brilliant successes,
and I've kept my word.

101
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:43,235
Order arms!

102
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:13,140
For Mother.

103
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:22,441
The current leadership of France
has passed from enthusiasm

104
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:23,817
to reckless ambition.

105
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:29,531
And the public perception
of the guillotine is lawless passion,

106
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:31,825
led by Robespierre.

107
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,328
He is unfit to rule.

108
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,003
Bonaparte.

109
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:46,173
Friends!

110
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:50,511
It has become increasingly clear,
Citizen Robespierre,

111
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:55,933
that your motivations are to use
this blade to your ultimate power!

112
00:16:56,892 --> 00:16:58,185
Let me speak!

113
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:03,774
There is no man in this room
who has objected to my methods.

114
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:08,445
If you say I am guilty,
you are all guilty!

115
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:12,241
You are not a defender of freedom.

116
00:17:12,324 --> 00:17:18,789
You have deemed yourself judge,
jury and executioner, have you not?

117
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:21,959
You're worse than Caesar!
Worse than Caesar!

118
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:25,254
You are, all of you, the traitors!

119
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:26,630
Arrest him!

120
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:28,966
Arrest him!

121
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,640
Coward!

122
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:44,982
-Get him!
-Get back.

123
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:49,903
No, no, no.

124
00:18:10,007 --> 00:18:11,133
You missed.

125
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:16,054
The guillotine, my friend.

126
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:48,373
A seven, madame.

127
00:20:52,336 --> 00:20:53,337
Deal again.

128
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:05,307
Deal again.

129
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:14,149
Your bets.

130
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:25,786
Seven again.

131
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:30,457
No. No win.

132
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:35,462
I'll be out first. That's mine.

133
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:47,224
Why are you staring at me?

134
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:49,017
Am I?

135
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:51,562
-Yes.
-No, I was not.

136
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:53,272
Oh, you weren't?

137
00:21:54,648 --> 00:21:55,649
I was.

138
00:21:57,067 --> 00:22:00,112
I was staring at your face.

139
00:22:01,113 --> 00:22:03,073
What is this costume you have on?

140
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:04,950
This is my uniform.

141
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:08,912
I led the French victory at Toulon.

142
00:22:16,086 --> 00:22:17,629
Do not tell me your name.

143
00:22:36,315 --> 00:22:37,107
General?

144
00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:41,278
There is a very young man
who wishes to see you.

145
00:22:41,403 --> 00:22:43,989
His name is Eugène Beauharnais.

146
00:22:53,248 --> 00:22:54,249
Citizen.

147
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:04,092
General Bonaparte.

148
00:23:04,176 --> 00:23:05,677
Yes?

149
00:23:05,761 --> 00:23:10,015
My name is Eugène Beauharnais,
son of Joséphine Beauharnais.

150
00:23:10,682 --> 00:23:11,683
What do you want?

151
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:14,186
My father's saber.

152
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:19,316
It was taken from him
before he was arrested and executed.

153
00:23:20,275 --> 00:23:21,109
Yes?

154
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:23,529
It would mean a great deal to me

155
00:23:23,612 --> 00:23:25,948
and to my mother
if it were returned to us.

156
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:27,824
It's all we have of him.

157
00:23:27,908 --> 00:23:29,326
The sword is a weapon.

158
00:23:30,869 --> 00:23:33,997
I cannot allow citizens
to have weapons in their possession.

159
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:38,585
The sword is a keepsake for me
to remember my dear late father.

160
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:41,171
Perhaps, but it is a weapon nevertheless.

161
00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:46,176
Young man, why are you here?

162
00:23:46,969 --> 00:23:50,848
My mother said that you were the only man
of authority to retrieve the sword.

163
00:24:03,318 --> 00:24:05,988
All of these are from officers
who were sentenced to die.

164
00:24:08,365 --> 00:24:11,159
Did no one think
to attach names to any of them?

165
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:16,081
No, there are no names.

166
00:24:40,731 --> 00:24:42,024
General Bonaparte?

167
00:24:52,284 --> 00:24:53,285
Thank you.

168
00:25:00,167 --> 00:25:02,336
Is there reason to introduce myself?

169
00:25:04,004 --> 00:25:05,088
No, general.

170
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:07,007
Good.

171
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:11,595
My compliments
to the chef of this fine family.

172
00:25:32,658 --> 00:25:34,451
Would you like to sit closer?

173
00:25:51,385 --> 00:25:53,011
Do I look like I'm in love?

174
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:57,391
Do you find him without appeal?

175
00:26:02,229 --> 00:26:03,105
No.

176
00:26:03,647 --> 00:26:05,482
Then perhaps that is enough.

177
00:26:10,654 --> 00:26:12,948
Do not underestimate your grace.

178
00:27:03,624 --> 00:27:05,834
When you look at me,
do you see an aristocrat?

179
00:27:10,047 --> 00:27:11,048
No.

180
00:27:14,927 --> 00:27:17,012
My husband had more than one lover.

181
00:27:19,181 --> 00:27:22,100
And when his head was cut off,
all his mistresses watched.

182
00:27:28,857 --> 00:27:29,858
When I was in prison,

183
00:27:29,942 --> 00:27:32,778
I was told the only way
to survive was to get pregnant.

184
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:36,698
So, general...

185
00:27:43,121 --> 00:27:45,707
do I need warn you of my indiscretions?

186
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,710
No, madame.

187
00:27:50,212 --> 00:27:52,464
Does where I have been concern you?

188
00:27:57,636 --> 00:27:58,679
No, madame.

189
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:18,615
If you look down, you'll see a surprise.

190
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,369
And once you see it,
you will always want it.

191
00:28:38,594 --> 00:28:41,638
People of France, don't be fooled.
There are more of us!

192
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:44,600
We can occupy this Convention!

193
00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:47,561
Long live the king!

194
00:28:48,103 --> 00:28:50,522
Long live the king!

195
00:28:50,606 --> 00:28:52,608
Long live the king!

196
00:28:52,691 --> 00:28:54,693
Long live the king!

197
00:28:54,776 --> 00:28:56,653
Long live the king!

198
00:28:56,778 --> 00:28:58,614
Long live the king!

199
00:28:58,697 --> 00:29:00,282
Long live the king!

200
00:29:02,284 --> 00:29:04,494
No doubt you've seen
the chaos in the streets.

201
00:29:04,578 --> 00:29:05,454
Yes.

202
00:29:06,455 --> 00:29:08,207
There is a belief amongst the Committee

203
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:11,168
that there is an attack
on the Council coming by this mob.

204
00:29:12,544 --> 00:29:16,882
I have less than 4000 troops
and very little in the way of weapons.

205
00:29:17,883 --> 00:29:21,887
There are 40 cannons in Sablons.
I could have them here in three hours.

206
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,972
This mob is 20,000 strong.

207
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:25,849
Yes.

208
00:29:29,895 --> 00:29:31,605
As my second-in-command...

209
00:29:32,856 --> 00:29:35,567
what would you intend to do
if this assignment of defense

210
00:29:35,651 --> 00:29:36,985
was transferred to you?

211
00:29:43,534 --> 00:29:46,828
I accept, on the condition
that I command this as I see fit.

212
00:29:46,912 --> 00:29:48,914
Without interruption.

213
00:29:49,957 --> 00:29:51,917
I will not lead as second-in-command.

214
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:00,717
Come on! Come on!

215
00:30:00,801 --> 00:30:01,885
Come on!

216
00:30:23,824 --> 00:30:25,075
Fire!

217
00:30:44,553 --> 00:30:49,600
According to the law
of 20th September, 1792,

218
00:30:50,392 --> 00:30:53,312
Marie-Josèphe-Rose Tascher,

219
00:30:53,395 --> 00:30:58,442
born 23rd June, 1767, in Martinique,

220
00:30:59,193 --> 00:31:03,322
accepts as her husband Napoleon Bonaparte,

221
00:31:03,405 --> 00:31:09,703
born February, 1768, in Ajaccio, Corsica.

222
00:31:11,496 --> 00:31:12,831
Do you consent?

223
00:31:12,915 --> 00:31:14,291
-Yes.
-I do.

224
00:31:14,416 --> 00:31:15,709
Do you consent?

225
00:31:18,545 --> 00:31:20,130
Yes. I do.

226
00:31:20,756 --> 00:31:23,759
I declare you united in marriage.

227
00:31:45,113 --> 00:31:47,115
To the savior of the Republic!

228
00:31:47,199 --> 00:31:48,784
And to Madame Bonaparte.

229
00:31:48,867 --> 00:31:50,327
To Madame Bonaparte.

230
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:10,514
This guy right next to me?

231
00:32:22,985 --> 00:32:24,403
He wrenched my saber...

232
00:32:40,586 --> 00:32:42,671
Let that good work make us a son.

233
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:00,189
Dear Joséphine,

234
00:33:01,064 --> 00:33:05,319
I follow in the footsteps
of Alexander the Great and Caesar,

235
00:33:05,402 --> 00:33:07,362
as I have been sent to liberate Egypt.

236
00:33:08,655 --> 00:33:10,991
I have 40,000 men,

237
00:33:11,074 --> 00:33:15,037
and the sights are wondrous,
and the weather is stifling hot.

238
00:33:16,788 --> 00:33:20,626
I have already conquered Italy,
who surrendered without conflict.

239
00:33:22,294 --> 00:33:25,422
The Directory has approved
my plan for attacking England

240
00:33:25,506 --> 00:33:27,299
through their eastern empire.

241
00:33:27,966 --> 00:33:31,887
But my achievements seem slight,
as they keep us apart.

242
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,249
Dear wife.

243
00:34:01,124 --> 00:34:03,919
This love I have for you
is a kind of death.

244
00:34:04,837 --> 00:34:07,297
There is no survival for me except in you.

245
00:34:07,381 --> 00:34:08,674
Hello again.

246
00:34:08,757 --> 00:34:10,008
What are you doing?

247
00:34:10,092 --> 00:34:11,635
No letters from you.

248
00:34:11,718 --> 00:34:12,719
Good morning, Lucille.

249
00:34:12,803 --> 00:34:15,305
If you loved me,
you'd write me twice a day.

250
00:34:16,014 --> 00:34:18,517
Tell me there are no snakes in your bed,

251
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:22,396
in your legs, inside what is mine.

252
00:34:23,146 --> 00:34:24,606
You must write me and tell me

253
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:28,569
that you realize that I love you
beyond the limits of imagination,

254
00:34:29,027 --> 00:34:31,280
that only you can please me.

255
00:36:52,296 --> 00:36:57,259
Are there limits to what I can tell you?

256
00:36:59,011 --> 00:37:00,137
There shouldn't be.

257
00:37:02,181 --> 00:37:05,142
Should I tell you something
at the risk of giving you personal pain?

258
00:37:07,227 --> 00:37:08,228
Yes.

259
00:37:15,402 --> 00:37:19,865
Your wife has taken a lover
named Hippolyte Charles.

260
00:37:40,594 --> 00:37:42,763
-You expect me to believe this?
-Yes.

261
00:37:44,932 --> 00:37:46,934
That my wife would do this to me?

262
00:37:48,393 --> 00:37:49,394
Yes.

263
00:37:59,738 --> 00:38:02,199
No dessert for you. You may leave.

264
00:38:05,827 --> 00:38:07,371
I would never lie to you.

265
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:24,930
How do you know this?

266
00:38:30,727 --> 00:38:32,771
Lucille is my lover.

267
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:34,773
She writes to me.

268
00:38:36,066 --> 00:38:38,610
Joséphine's lady-in-waiting is your lover?

269
00:38:49,413 --> 00:38:51,874
Prepare two frigates
and two smaller vessels,

270
00:38:51,957 --> 00:38:53,417
in the greatest secrecy.

271
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:56,086
I'm returning home.

272
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:57,629
Napoleon...

273
00:38:58,505 --> 00:39:00,632
this will be seen as desertion.

274
00:39:03,093 --> 00:39:05,596
General Kléber will be informed
of his succession to command

275
00:39:05,721 --> 00:39:06,763
after I've left.

276
00:39:16,315 --> 00:39:18,442
Napoleon the victorious!

277
00:40:08,742 --> 00:40:09,868
Where's my wife?

278
00:40:09,952 --> 00:40:11,703
She has left to greet you in Lyon.

279
00:40:12,663 --> 00:40:14,915
Do not lie to me. Where is my wife?

280
00:40:14,998 --> 00:40:16,750
She left earlier today, general.

281
00:40:16,834 --> 00:40:18,794
-Lyon?
-Yes, sir.

282
00:40:18,877 --> 00:40:22,005
The entire world knows of my arrival
but not my wife?

283
00:41:12,347 --> 00:41:14,308
What kind of creature are you?

284
00:41:17,477 --> 00:41:21,940
How could you care so little
for me and my feelings?

285
00:41:23,317 --> 00:41:26,612
-You are a selfish, little pig.
-No...

286
00:41:28,363 --> 00:41:30,449
You think so lowly of me?

287
00:41:31,658 --> 00:41:33,452
No. I don't.

288
00:41:33,535 --> 00:41:34,536
Then why?

289
00:41:37,372 --> 00:41:38,582
Because you're what?

290
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:40,834
Say it.

291
00:41:44,671 --> 00:41:45,714
I'm sorry.

292
00:41:46,548 --> 00:41:47,674
That's not enough.

293
00:41:49,218 --> 00:41:51,053
What do you want me to say?

294
00:41:51,136 --> 00:41:56,225
I want you to say that I am
the most important thing in the world!

295
00:41:57,142 --> 00:41:59,186
-You are.
-Say it!

296
00:41:59,269 --> 00:42:05,526
You're the most important thing
in my life, in the world.

297
00:42:05,609 --> 00:42:08,237
-You--
-And without me, you are nothing.

298
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,906
-I'm nothing.
-And you will do anything!

299
00:42:11,823 --> 00:42:13,242
I'll do anything.

300
00:42:16,745 --> 00:42:18,455
I'm not built like other men.

301
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:24,294
And I'm not subject to petty insecurity.

302
00:42:29,716 --> 00:42:31,093
You're a beast.

303
00:42:35,848 --> 00:42:37,266
I feel sorry for you.

304
00:42:41,436 --> 00:42:42,855
You want to be great?

305
00:42:50,654 --> 00:42:53,156
You are nothing without me.

306
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:55,576
Say it.

307
00:43:03,917 --> 00:43:05,043
Say it.

308
00:43:11,216 --> 00:43:16,722
You are just a brute
that is nothing without me.

309
00:43:18,056 --> 00:43:22,102
I am just a brute
that is nothing without you.

310
00:43:22,227 --> 00:43:23,020
Yes.

311
00:43:23,103 --> 00:43:24,730
You are nothing...

312
00:43:26,565 --> 00:43:29,985
without me or your mother.

313
00:43:33,447 --> 00:43:34,615
My mother...

314
00:43:49,463 --> 00:43:50,839
Did you have affairs?

315
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,426
Of course I did.

316
00:44:01,683 --> 00:44:03,310
And did you love them?

317
00:44:04,311 --> 00:44:06,772
No. No, I did not.

318
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:14,321
Were they pretty?

319
00:44:16,323 --> 00:44:18,367
Yes, some of them.

320
00:44:21,328 --> 00:44:22,913
They served their purpose.

321
00:44:24,998 --> 00:44:26,166
More than I do?

322
00:44:27,042 --> 00:44:30,838
They cried less.
That made them more attractive.

323
00:44:34,258 --> 00:44:35,259
Don't...

324
00:44:36,677 --> 00:44:39,137
Don't leave me. Please don't leave me.

325
00:44:42,891 --> 00:44:44,309
Just don't leave me.

326
00:44:46,144 --> 00:44:49,314
You don't have to forgive me.
Just promise me you won't leave again.

327
00:44:55,028 --> 00:44:58,740
What is it that made you desert
your troops in Egypt?

328
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:03,161
Citizens...

329
00:45:05,539 --> 00:45:06,915
what country are we in?

330
00:45:10,544 --> 00:45:13,630
Because she doesn't resemble
the France that I left.

331
00:45:17,092 --> 00:45:20,554
Who should be responsible
for her governance while I'm away?

332
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,016
Because it is not you, Citizen Gohier.

333
00:45:24,725 --> 00:45:25,809
And it is not you.

334
00:45:25,893 --> 00:45:29,646
It certainly is not you.
Although you're very good at scowling.

335
00:45:32,441 --> 00:45:34,526
It's not you, Barras.

336
00:45:34,651 --> 00:45:35,777
Or you, Talleyrand.

337
00:45:37,196 --> 00:45:38,238
Or you, Sieyès.

338
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:40,407
So who?

339
00:45:42,201 --> 00:45:44,828
Who should be responsible?
Fouché, do you have any ideas?

340
00:45:46,205 --> 00:45:47,206
No?

341
00:45:49,374 --> 00:45:52,211
I have returned to France
to find her bankrupt.

342
00:45:53,629 --> 00:45:56,131
Printing money
that is spent within hours...

343
00:45:57,925 --> 00:46:00,135
the Austro-Russian overrun of Italy...

344
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:03,680
the Anglo-Russian occupation of Holland,

345
00:46:04,306 --> 00:46:10,187
and what appears to be
the imminent invasion of France herself.

346
00:46:13,065 --> 00:46:16,610
And yet, you accuse me of desertion.

347
00:46:17,986 --> 00:46:21,406
Added to which the discovery
that my wife is a slut.

348
00:46:34,545 --> 00:46:39,758
The only thing that every French citizen
can agree on is that you are our Caesar.

349
00:46:43,262 --> 00:46:44,263
What do you want?

350
00:46:48,392 --> 00:46:49,393
Well...

351
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:55,399
the people will accept my rule
if I have your support.

352
00:46:57,651 --> 00:47:02,447
Like you, though,
I believe that the Directory is corrupt.

353
00:47:03,991 --> 00:47:08,871
But together, we can save this country
from a restoration of the monarchy...

354
00:47:09,913 --> 00:47:12,124
and we can preserve
the ideals of the Revolution.

355
00:47:14,793 --> 00:47:18,589
And I think
that a seizure of power is possible...

356
00:47:19,965 --> 00:47:21,717
with your help, at the right time.

357
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,970
And I think this is the right time.

358
00:47:25,804 --> 00:47:28,891
So you expect me to be your sword?

359
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,773
I expect that a coup d'état...

360
00:47:38,108 --> 00:47:39,985
well-timed, well-executed...

361
00:47:42,487 --> 00:47:45,657
could transfer power
into the hands of three consuls.

362
00:47:46,366 --> 00:47:47,743
Myself, Ducos...

363
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:51,371
and you.

364
00:47:53,957 --> 00:47:56,251
I'm inviting you to the winning side.

365
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:02,716
It's a simple letter of resignation
we would like you to--

366
00:48:02,799 --> 00:48:04,927
I am not signing anything.

367
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:08,305
You can piss before I sign anything away!

368
00:48:08,388 --> 00:48:09,389
Gentlemen.

369
00:48:18,232 --> 00:48:19,775
Who's doing this?

370
00:48:21,026 --> 00:48:22,819
Good morning, Paul.

371
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,324
I'm going to make this
very simple for you.

372
00:48:28,075 --> 00:48:31,954
I have documents announcing
your resignation from the Council.

373
00:48:32,538 --> 00:48:35,582
You must retire
before you have your breakfast, please.

374
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:40,963
Tell them I return with joy
to the ranks of simple citizen.

375
00:48:43,131 --> 00:48:44,132
I shall.

376
00:48:49,304 --> 00:48:51,348
There are some gentlemen here to see you.

377
00:48:52,182 --> 00:48:53,392
Citizen Moulin.

378
00:48:54,434 --> 00:48:56,395
We have a letter
of resignation for you to sign.

379
00:48:56,478 --> 00:48:59,648
-No, no, no. I am eating my breakfast.
-No.

380
00:48:59,731 --> 00:49:02,526
I am enjoying a succulent breakfast.

381
00:49:02,609 --> 00:49:04,444
This is outrageous!

382
00:49:04,528 --> 00:49:06,697
I shall finish my breakfast
before you touch me!

383
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:07,614
No!

384
00:49:08,198 --> 00:49:09,575
Enjoy your breakfast.

385
00:49:31,513 --> 00:49:32,598
Director!

386
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:36,018
I believe the time has come
to demand an explanation.

387
00:49:36,101 --> 00:49:37,102
Hear, hear!

388
00:49:38,353 --> 00:49:42,900
This emergency session is to draw
a list of nominations

389
00:49:42,983 --> 00:49:48,071
for a new Directory
to deal with the threat--

390
00:49:48,155 --> 00:49:50,199
The threat of the royalists.

391
00:49:50,282 --> 00:49:52,451
We are being asked to pass a resolution

392
00:49:52,534 --> 00:49:55,495
forming a provisional government
to three consuls:

393
00:49:56,371 --> 00:50:00,125
General Bonaparte
and Citizens Sieyès and Roger Ducos.

394
00:50:01,335 --> 00:50:03,670
Where are the five members
of the Directory?

395
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:07,716
Have they magically disappeared?

396
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:12,888
And we are here, surrounded by troops,
isolated far from Paris.

397
00:50:13,555 --> 00:50:14,556
Order. Order!

398
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,518
This is becoming increasingly clear:

399
00:50:18,393 --> 00:50:21,396
That your brother, Napoleon Bonaparte,

400
00:50:22,523 --> 00:50:26,485
with his show of military might,
is acting as an outlaw.

401
00:50:28,403 --> 00:50:31,031
-A vote will solve this matter.
-And that this is a ridiculous

402
00:50:31,114 --> 00:50:33,367
and poorly executed takeover.

403
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:35,827
A power-hungry upstart.

404
00:50:35,953 --> 00:50:38,247
Enough! Enough!

405
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:42,459
If there is any question
of what has happened here, I will answer!

406
00:50:42,543 --> 00:50:43,627
How dare you?

407
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:44,920
This is...

408
00:50:45,003 --> 00:50:47,339
You have violated the constitution!

409
00:50:47,464 --> 00:50:48,841
-You have--
-Hold him!

410
00:50:48,924 --> 00:50:50,968
-Hold him!
-Get him!

411
00:50:58,934 --> 00:51:00,352
Arrest him!

412
00:51:00,435 --> 00:51:01,436
Stop him!

413
00:51:02,938 --> 00:51:04,147
Oh, fuck!

414
00:51:04,231 --> 00:51:05,440
-Get him!
-Grab him!

415
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,863
Kill him!

416
00:51:19,204 --> 00:51:20,247
Let me through!

417
00:51:23,083 --> 00:51:24,251
Right.

418
00:51:24,334 --> 00:51:28,839
We are being terrorized
by deputies armed with daggers.

419
00:51:28,922 --> 00:51:32,384
And these madmen have outlawed themselves

420
00:51:32,467 --> 00:51:35,095
by their attempt
on the liberty of this country!

421
00:51:35,179 --> 00:51:38,098
-They're trying to kill me!
-They're trying to kill him.

422
00:51:38,182 --> 00:51:40,350
Open these doors!

423
00:51:44,688 --> 00:51:46,106
Let us out of here!

424
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:51,195
I will kill my brother if he betrays
the freedom of the French people.

425
00:51:52,779 --> 00:51:54,031
Get in there now!

426
00:51:54,156 --> 00:51:55,115
Fuck!

427
00:52:00,162 --> 00:52:02,497
Move. Move. Get back. Back.

428
00:52:03,624 --> 00:52:05,083
Move it! Move it!

429
00:52:07,127 --> 00:52:10,130
-Back. Back. Move back.
-Move back. Out of the way.

430
00:52:10,714 --> 00:52:11,924
Move now!

431
00:52:12,007 --> 00:52:13,008
Backwards.

432
00:52:19,348 --> 00:52:20,724
Good luck, brother.

433
00:52:31,235 --> 00:52:32,361
Stand aside.

434
00:52:45,249 --> 00:52:46,208
Shall we vote?

435
00:52:50,003 --> 00:52:51,129
Where are we going?

436
00:52:53,757 --> 00:52:55,884
All our harsh words are behind us.

437
00:52:58,554 --> 00:53:01,223
I need you to be my most tender friend.

438
00:53:04,893 --> 00:53:08,272
Over this door is our destiny.

439
00:54:24,806 --> 00:54:26,934
Present arms!

440
00:54:39,321 --> 00:54:40,489
First Consul.

441
00:54:42,449 --> 00:54:43,450
Milady.

442
00:54:47,371 --> 00:54:49,206
-Citizen Bonaparte.
-Citizen Bonaparte.

443
00:54:49,331 --> 00:54:50,791
-First Consul.
-Citizen Bonaparte.

444
00:54:50,874 --> 00:54:52,251
First Consul.

445
00:54:55,712 --> 00:54:56,922
Come, little one.

446
00:54:57,756 --> 00:55:00,884
You get into the bed of your master's.

447
00:55:13,981 --> 00:55:17,025
Hello, madame!

448
00:55:17,568 --> 00:55:18,777
Hello, good evening.

449
00:55:24,032 --> 00:55:25,868
Mother, the Duke of Avignon.

450
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:27,286
It's good to meet you.

451
00:55:38,172 --> 00:55:39,715
Could this be Joséphine?

452
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:43,385
-Mother, Joséphine. Joséphine, Mother.
-Good to see you.

453
00:55:45,095 --> 00:55:47,848
It's Charles. This way.

454
00:55:57,608 --> 00:56:01,320
"Your Majesty, England and France
are wasting their prosperity."

455
00:56:01,403 --> 00:56:02,404
Let me try again.

456
00:56:04,781 --> 00:56:09,036
Your Royal Majesty, England and France
are wasting their prosperity...

457
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:12,206
-Your Majesty.
-What did I say?

458
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:16,460
"Your Royal Majesty."

459
00:56:17,586 --> 00:56:18,587
Your Royal Ma--

460
00:56:19,922 --> 00:56:23,842
"Your Majesty, England and France
are wasting their prosperity.

461
00:56:25,969 --> 00:56:28,514
I am not ashamed to take the initiative.

462
00:56:28,597 --> 00:56:31,308
I have, I think,
sufficiently proven to the whole world

463
00:56:31,391 --> 00:56:34,269
that I do not fear the chances of war.

464
00:56:35,604 --> 00:56:40,025
But peace is my heartfelt wish
for England and France."

465
00:56:41,276 --> 00:56:42,402
Read it back to me.

466
00:56:43,278 --> 00:56:46,573
I have notified all foreign powers
of your accession to the Consul,

467
00:56:46,657 --> 00:56:50,369
I have addressed letters
to all diplomatic agents abroad,

468
00:56:50,452 --> 00:56:54,665
and you have made friendly overtures
of peace to England.

469
00:56:54,748 --> 00:56:55,749
Caulaincourt.

470
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:59,419
What I need from you
is a better understanding

471
00:56:59,503 --> 00:57:01,964
of the Russian Tsar Alexander.

472
00:57:02,047 --> 00:57:05,384
Would you consider the tsar
an ally to England or France?

473
00:57:06,718 --> 00:57:10,848
Well, I would think that his trade
with England is more beneficial to him

474
00:57:10,931 --> 00:57:12,307
than his trade with France.

475
00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:14,142
And do you have a sense of...

476
00:57:14,935 --> 00:57:16,854
British influence in the Russian courts?

477
00:57:16,937 --> 00:57:19,606
I do not,
but I imagine it is quite robust.

478
00:57:20,858 --> 00:57:21,984
Robust?

479
00:57:26,947 --> 00:57:29,908
What kind of man is he? Describe him.

480
00:57:31,451 --> 00:57:32,619
Well, he's young.

481
00:57:34,955 --> 00:57:35,998
He's vain.

482
00:57:37,666 --> 00:57:39,585
He's popular, and he wishes to remain so.

483
00:57:39,668 --> 00:57:40,711
He's popular?

484
00:57:43,589 --> 00:57:44,673
Really?

485
00:57:44,756 --> 00:57:48,343
His greatest fear is to be killed
in his bed, like his father.

486
00:57:50,679 --> 00:57:55,058
This makes him dangerously fickle
to whoever last has his attention.

487
00:57:56,143 --> 00:57:59,313
So he needs an ally
that he can also call a friend.

488
00:58:06,028 --> 00:58:07,446
No more bets.

489
00:58:10,991 --> 00:58:12,284
What a surprise.

490
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,912
How nice to see you out.

491
00:58:15,454 --> 00:58:17,122
Excuse me, gentlemen.

492
00:58:17,206 --> 00:58:20,042
Good evening.
I'm just trying to lose some money.

493
00:58:21,335 --> 00:58:23,504
After this hand,
why don't you come and join me?

494
00:58:23,587 --> 00:58:25,088
I'm at my usual table.

495
00:58:25,214 --> 00:58:26,548
That's a lovely idea.

496
00:58:28,467 --> 00:58:29,468
Good evening.

497
00:58:32,054 --> 00:58:33,096
Did you hear?

498
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:39,978
Your Majesty received a letter of peace
from the First Consul today.

499
00:58:41,605 --> 00:58:45,359
Monsieur Talleyrand, if I may be honest?

500
00:58:45,442 --> 00:58:48,111
-Of course.
-Austria's coalition with England

501
00:58:48,195 --> 00:58:51,114
is in such a strong position
against France,

502
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:56,203
that these peace overtures
are clearly only for your handling

503
00:58:56,286 --> 00:58:58,288
of French public opinion.

504
00:58:59,581 --> 00:59:00,707
Oh, my friend.

505
00:59:02,626 --> 00:59:04,211
You know me so well.

506
00:59:05,546 --> 00:59:09,091
Yes, it is true,
it is public opinion Napoleon is after,

507
00:59:09,174 --> 00:59:12,177
but my warning to you
is that he's as hungry for it

508
00:59:12,261 --> 00:59:14,346
as any man in the history of the world.

509
00:59:14,429 --> 00:59:16,098
So my suggestion, with respect,

510
00:59:16,181 --> 00:59:20,060
would be to take
this little offering of peace from him.

511
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:28,777
Or suffer the consequences
from a man bent on peace at any cost.

512
00:59:30,779 --> 00:59:34,074
The English ambassador, Lord Whitworth,
has arrived, Consul.

513
00:59:42,749 --> 00:59:46,086
Do not look at me as if you don't know
what I'm about to say.

514
00:59:47,713 --> 00:59:50,549
Are you aware of my letter of peace
to your king?

515
00:59:51,175 --> 00:59:52,259
I am not.

516
00:59:53,677 --> 00:59:55,137
Shall I repeat it?

517
00:59:56,388 --> 00:59:58,265
No, you may not.

518
00:59:58,891 --> 01:00:01,226
Take this as a warning to your king.

519
01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:03,937
I will keep you guessing and scared.

520
01:00:04,021 --> 01:00:06,190
You will watch your borders and your back,

521
01:00:06,315 --> 01:00:09,276
and your manners are bound,
sooner or later, to be French.

522
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:11,653
I will offer no more letters of peace,

523
01:00:11,737 --> 01:00:16,241
and I will take the lack of a swift reply
as an act of disrespect!

524
01:00:16,325 --> 01:00:19,453
You think you're so great
because you have boats!

525
01:00:23,081 --> 01:00:26,168
'Tis a shame such a great man
should have no manners.

526
01:00:39,515 --> 01:00:40,516
Yes?

527
01:00:43,018 --> 01:00:44,102
Are you pleased?

528
01:00:46,647 --> 01:00:49,316
Are you about to tell me something
that will make me angry?

529
01:00:50,192 --> 01:00:51,610
Let's hope not.

530
01:00:51,693 --> 01:00:56,823
The European families think
nothing more of you than a Corsican thug.

531
01:00:56,907 --> 01:00:57,908
Therefore...

532
01:00:58,742 --> 01:01:02,538
I'm going to suggest something
that's been a long time arriving.

533
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:08,293
I suggest that you abandon your role
as First Consul of France...

534
01:01:09,253 --> 01:01:13,757
in exchange
for the title "Victorious Consul."

535
01:01:15,634 --> 01:01:18,095
By another name, "king."

536
01:01:21,014 --> 01:01:22,015
What?

537
01:01:23,559 --> 01:01:24,643
"King."

538
01:01:27,104 --> 01:01:28,146
Yes. King.

539
01:01:30,691 --> 01:01:31,692
King?

540
01:01:51,753 --> 01:01:53,380
My hair has been set.

541
01:01:54,673 --> 01:01:56,216
The way you like it.

542
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:03,307
Oh, you filthy man.
My hair has been set now.

543
01:02:07,394 --> 01:02:09,646
I have the most beautiful wife.

544
01:02:09,730 --> 01:02:11,815
I-- All right, come on, then.

545
01:02:14,818 --> 01:02:15,819
Hat off.

546
01:02:22,951 --> 01:02:24,703
Give me your hand. Give me your hand.

547
01:02:25,871 --> 01:02:27,664
-You feel that?
-What?

548
01:02:29,291 --> 01:02:31,376
Can you feel that? That's yours.

549
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:34,087
That's yours. It's yours.

550
01:02:34,171 --> 01:02:35,172
Thank you.

551
01:02:58,904 --> 01:02:59,905
Stop.

552
01:03:00,656 --> 01:03:02,241
Why aren't you pregnant?

553
01:03:06,453 --> 01:03:09,873
Is that a question,
or is that an accusation?

554
01:03:13,877 --> 01:03:15,170
It was a question.

555
01:03:17,381 --> 01:03:18,882
Now it's an accusation.

556
01:03:22,469 --> 01:03:25,681
Well, I've seen Dr. Corvisart
and he has no answer.

557
01:03:29,726 --> 01:03:32,563
Only that I do
what Madame de Rémusat has done.

558
01:03:34,857 --> 01:03:35,816
Which is?

559
01:03:37,359 --> 01:03:38,443
Which is...

560
01:03:40,737 --> 01:03:43,657
along with hopeful thinking
and a bit of red wine,

561
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:46,743
he suggested
I take the waters at Aix-la-Chapelle.

562
01:03:50,038 --> 01:03:51,331
And why haven't you?

563
01:03:52,708 --> 01:03:55,502
As wife of the First Consul,
I haven't found the time.

564
01:03:55,586 --> 01:03:58,547
I spend many hours cleaning up after you.

565
01:04:03,093 --> 01:04:04,136
Find the time.

566
01:04:06,930 --> 01:04:09,641
I don't need to explain to you
the importance of this, do I?

567
01:04:10,642 --> 01:04:12,019
What, you want an heir?

568
01:04:12,811 --> 01:04:14,104
I want one now.

569
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:33,582
Oh, my God.

570
01:05:22,381 --> 01:05:25,092
May God affirm you on His throne...

571
01:05:26,343 --> 01:05:31,348
and Christ give you to rule with Him
in His eternal kingdom.

572
01:05:57,416 --> 01:06:00,711
I found the crown of France in the gutter.

573
01:06:02,671 --> 01:06:07,217
I picked it up with the tip of my sword
and cleaned it...

574
01:06:09,178 --> 01:06:11,305
and place it atop my own head.

575
01:06:37,414 --> 01:06:43,086
The most glorious,
the most august Napoleon,

576
01:06:43,170 --> 01:06:45,714
emperor of the French,

577
01:06:45,797 --> 01:06:49,384
is crowned and enthroned!

578
01:06:49,968 --> 01:06:51,762
Long live the emperor!

579
01:06:51,845 --> 01:06:54,389
Long live the emperor!

580
01:06:54,932 --> 01:06:56,850
Long live the emperor!

581
01:07:36,807 --> 01:07:38,684
I do not support this idea.

582
01:07:38,767 --> 01:07:41,353
You suggest divorce after years of debate.

583
01:07:41,436 --> 01:07:43,564
You can see that it has me divided.

584
01:07:47,526 --> 01:07:51,196
I am not ambitious.
I've never declared war with anyone.

585
01:07:54,908 --> 01:07:55,909
No.

586
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:02,541
You are the greatest leader
in the history of the world

587
01:08:02,624 --> 01:08:04,585
and the world's only chance at peace.

588
01:08:09,173 --> 01:08:12,259
The security of the empire
and peace in the world

589
01:08:12,342 --> 01:08:13,760
depends upon an heir.

590
01:08:21,226 --> 01:08:22,436
It was an option.

591
01:08:24,354 --> 01:08:25,939
And I said it at the time.

592
01:08:33,155 --> 01:08:34,656
Are you enjoying yourself?

593
01:08:36,783 --> 01:08:39,620
I'm going to war to defend our people,

594
01:08:40,412 --> 01:08:42,915
and my wife cannot provide me an heir.

595
01:08:46,502 --> 01:08:49,254
If you do not bear me a child tonight...

596
01:08:50,923 --> 01:08:52,549
there will be a divorce.

597
01:08:54,968 --> 01:08:58,430
Hasn't been enough lovemaking
in this home to bear a child.

598
01:08:59,431 --> 01:09:00,641
Yes, there has.

599
01:09:02,684 --> 01:09:05,771
There have been years of it. Years.

600
01:09:07,231 --> 01:09:08,774
And with more than just me.

601
01:09:10,150 --> 01:09:11,360
And still...

602
01:09:12,611 --> 01:09:13,612
you are empty.

603
01:09:13,737 --> 01:09:15,364
And you're fat.

604
01:09:16,865 --> 01:09:20,244
I enjoy my meals. I do.

605
01:09:21,203 --> 01:09:22,871
Destiny has brought me here.

606
01:09:22,955 --> 01:09:25,582
Destiny has brought me this lamb chop.

607
01:09:50,732 --> 01:09:51,900
Joséphine.

608
01:09:56,363 --> 01:09:57,406
Come, then.

609
01:09:59,032 --> 01:10:00,033
Come.

610
01:10:06,623 --> 01:10:10,502
I love your talents and your taste.

611
01:10:12,713 --> 01:10:15,674
And while I'm away,
I will miss your grace.

612
01:10:16,175 --> 01:10:17,509
And your dignity.

613
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:20,679
And I will come back to you.

614
01:10:54,630 --> 01:10:56,048
To today's victory.

615
01:10:57,382 --> 01:10:59,259
Look, I'm always here for you, Francis.

616
01:11:00,511 --> 01:11:03,639
But I must admit, I'm overwhelmed
with the excitement of the battlefield.

617
01:11:04,306 --> 01:11:06,558
I should not deceive you, Alexander.

618
01:11:06,642 --> 01:11:09,811
This battle against him
will be brutal and terrifying.

619
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:36,421
Come on!

620
01:11:37,047 --> 01:11:38,382
Get in defensive position!

621
01:11:48,725 --> 01:11:50,644
My good wife, Joséphine,

622
01:11:51,436 --> 01:11:52,980
my God, it's cold here.

623
01:11:53,981 --> 01:11:55,357
I miss your warmth.

624
01:11:56,483 --> 01:12:00,362
On this day, we celebrate
the first anniversary of our coronation.

625
01:12:02,030 --> 01:12:04,908
My previous ally has now joined
with my enemy.

626
01:12:05,784 --> 01:12:09,746
The Russian Tsar Alexander joined forces
with the prince of Austria.

627
01:12:10,622 --> 01:12:12,791
I have heard
that he's been studying the art of war

628
01:12:12,875 --> 01:12:15,377
and trying to emulate my battle tactics.

629
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:16,295
More fires.

630
01:12:16,378 --> 01:12:17,713
He tries to copy me,

631
01:12:18,338 --> 01:12:21,675
but he is a little boy
who will make a terrible mistake.

632
01:12:22,217 --> 01:12:25,095
I am certain I will bring
the laurels of another glorious victory

633
01:12:25,179 --> 01:12:26,263
to my army today.

634
01:12:27,264 --> 01:12:29,391
Yours, Napoleon.

635
01:12:44,948 --> 01:12:47,868
Hey, tie it from the back.
Peg that corner to the ground.

636
01:12:47,951 --> 01:12:48,952
That's it.

637
01:12:56,668 --> 01:12:57,669
Fuck.

638
01:13:53,809 --> 01:13:54,685
Your Majesty.

639
01:13:56,061 --> 01:13:57,145
We are discovered.

640
01:13:59,189 --> 01:14:00,190
Good.

641
01:14:01,650 --> 01:14:02,901
Tell the men to rest.

642
01:14:33,223 --> 01:14:34,349
I...

643
01:14:34,433 --> 01:14:35,309
N...

644
01:14:35,392 --> 01:14:36,476
F...

645
01:14:37,603 --> 01:14:38,604
S.

646
01:14:40,147 --> 01:14:41,440
Infantry sighted.

647
01:14:55,412 --> 01:14:56,246
I...

648
01:14:56,914 --> 01:14:57,706
M...

649
01:14:58,457 --> 01:14:59,458
T.

650
01:15:01,668 --> 01:15:02,794
Imminent!

651
01:15:05,464 --> 01:15:07,591
Stand to!

652
01:15:07,674 --> 01:15:10,344
-Stand to!
-Stand to!

653
01:15:10,427 --> 01:15:11,929
-Stand to!
-Stand to.

654
01:15:12,012 --> 01:15:15,349
-Wake up, men. Get ready!
-Stand to!

655
01:15:15,432 --> 01:15:17,100
Come on, get up!

656
01:15:44,545 --> 01:15:46,213
Wait, wait.

657
01:15:46,296 --> 01:15:47,256
Ready!

658
01:15:47,339 --> 01:15:51,051
Wait! Let them think
they have the higher ground.

659
01:16:37,097 --> 01:16:38,182
Fire!

660
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:42,853
Fire away!

661
01:16:50,736 --> 01:16:52,321
Fire at will!

662
01:16:58,243 --> 01:16:59,244
Send in the infantry.

663
01:16:59,328 --> 01:17:01,788
Take their position on the higher ground.
At the double.

664
01:17:01,914 --> 01:17:04,249
Take the ground!

665
01:17:36,657 --> 01:17:39,326
Cavalry from the west.
Pierce their flanks.

666
01:17:53,382 --> 01:17:56,468
Retreat! Withdraw!

667
01:17:56,552 --> 01:17:58,220
Withdraw!

668
01:18:09,731 --> 01:18:10,983
It's a trap!

669
01:18:15,696 --> 01:18:17,406
Retreat!

670
01:18:55,652 --> 01:18:59,031
-Uncover the cannons.
-Cannons!

671
01:19:03,118 --> 01:19:05,370
-Fire!
-Fire!

672
01:19:09,374 --> 01:19:10,375
Reloading!

673
01:19:28,477 --> 01:19:30,270
Keep to the one side.

674
01:19:41,949 --> 01:19:44,159
Off the ice!

675
01:20:33,834 --> 01:20:36,545
Renounce, sir. We're pinned in.

676
01:20:39,131 --> 01:20:41,675
Off the ice! Withdraw!

677
01:20:48,515 --> 01:20:49,725
Cut off their retreat.

678
01:21:40,943 --> 01:21:43,779
Francis. So nice to finally meet you.

679
01:21:44,321 --> 01:21:45,739
Please come in where it's warm.

680
01:21:46,740 --> 01:21:49,117
-Thank you.
-You must forgive me.

681
01:21:49,201 --> 01:21:51,662
This has been my only palace
for the last two months.

682
01:21:52,913 --> 01:21:56,875
Seems very agreeable.
You make excellent use of it.

683
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,002
Well, we do what we can
on the battlefield.

684
01:21:59,753 --> 01:22:01,463
Yes, we do, don't we?

685
01:22:02,214 --> 01:22:04,341
It's nice to finally meet another emperor.

686
01:22:05,676 --> 01:22:07,803
Where, may I ask, is Alexander?

687
01:22:07,886 --> 01:22:10,347
Are we waiting for his arrival
before we get started?

688
01:22:10,430 --> 01:22:14,142
I do not believe he will be joining us.

689
01:22:14,226 --> 01:22:16,478
He's beside himself with rage.

690
01:22:19,064 --> 01:22:23,819
I realize I must compliment you
for making me commit an enormous error.

691
01:22:24,444 --> 01:22:26,321
-An error?
-Yes.

692
01:22:27,406 --> 01:22:29,241
What error have you made?

693
01:22:30,701 --> 01:22:34,538
To be speaking with you here
and accepting this invitation for peace,

694
01:22:34,621 --> 01:22:36,665
I have not followed up my victory.

695
01:22:37,875 --> 01:22:41,628
I could have taken the whole Russian
and Austrian army prisoners.

696
01:22:44,089 --> 01:22:45,090
Yes.

697
01:22:45,841 --> 01:22:47,926
But after all, there will be less tears.

698
01:22:49,386 --> 01:22:53,765
And I know you will remember
this gesture of kindness. Yes?

699
01:22:55,058 --> 01:22:56,059
Thank you.

700
01:23:00,898 --> 01:23:01,899
Toast?

701
01:23:10,824 --> 01:23:14,494
To friendship, a glorious peace...

702
01:23:15,454 --> 01:23:17,456
and the best interests of Europe.

703
01:23:24,671 --> 01:23:25,672
Burgundy.

704
01:23:48,820 --> 01:23:51,031
Hold on. Hey, whoa!

705
01:23:51,782 --> 01:23:53,408
Whoa, we don't say woof. Okay.

706
01:23:55,953 --> 01:23:58,872
That's my boy. Attaboy.

707
01:23:58,997 --> 01:24:00,541
Come here, come here. Sit.

708
01:24:15,848 --> 01:24:19,852
It is time
to put this mystery to rest, emperor.

709
01:24:19,935 --> 01:24:23,272
I want to know if it's you or Joséphine.

710
01:24:23,355 --> 01:24:30,112
And to that end, we will conduct
a very practical experiment.

711
01:24:32,948 --> 01:24:36,118
At the end of the hallway-- Take this.

712
01:24:37,077 --> 01:24:41,123
Waiting for you, undressed,
ready to receive,

713
01:24:41,874 --> 01:24:46,420
is 18-year-old
Eléonore Denuelle de La Plaigne.

714
01:24:49,506 --> 01:24:51,717
She's brunette with brown eyes.

715
01:24:52,384 --> 01:24:56,430
And the object of this, well,
hardly unpleasant task...

716
01:24:57,389 --> 01:24:59,808
is to see if you can father a child.

717
01:25:01,059 --> 01:25:05,022
And then we will have an answer
to this nagging question

718
01:25:05,105 --> 01:25:10,277
of who is keeping who
from an heir to the throne of France.

719
01:25:15,616 --> 01:25:18,452
-Shall we go?
-May I have another, please?

720
01:26:18,595 --> 01:26:21,515
The girl is pregnant.
You made her pregnant.

721
01:26:35,821 --> 01:26:37,364
I know I didn't hear her.

722
01:26:44,288 --> 01:26:46,707
When are you going to insist we divorce?

723
01:26:48,458 --> 01:26:50,085
Isn't that wonderful?

724
01:26:51,837 --> 01:26:55,966
From the only woman that I've ever loved
and given all that I've conquered.

725
01:26:56,049 --> 01:26:57,676
I'm just too tired...

726
01:26:59,261 --> 01:27:02,139
to wait for you to tell me
what I know is coming.

727
01:27:04,349 --> 01:27:05,851
If you insist.

728
01:27:09,479 --> 01:27:11,356
I'll make it easier for you.

729
01:27:17,487 --> 01:27:20,115
I know you will have a bastard child.

730
01:27:25,204 --> 01:27:29,374
If I succeed in making the birth of a boy
that I shall call my own son,

731
01:27:30,083 --> 01:27:34,213
I want you as a witness
to pretend the confinement of the empress.

732
01:27:36,673 --> 01:27:38,342
Your Highness, you are asking me

733
01:27:38,425 --> 01:27:40,928
to lie about the status
of the mother of your heir.

734
01:27:42,638 --> 01:27:44,640
That is another way of putting it, yes.

735
01:27:46,934 --> 01:27:47,935
Emperor,

736
01:27:48,894 --> 01:27:54,191
it is my honor and my duty, of course,
to do as you require of me.

737
01:27:54,274 --> 01:27:58,654
But if asked, I cannot contain
that which I know to be the truth.

738
01:27:59,738 --> 01:28:01,532
And painful though it is,

739
01:28:01,615 --> 01:28:03,659
the truth is that the empress

740
01:28:03,742 --> 01:28:06,370
is no longer capable
of bearing you a child.

741
01:28:17,589 --> 01:28:19,675
My good Joséphine.

742
01:28:24,555 --> 01:28:26,431
You know how I've loved you.

743
01:28:29,226 --> 01:28:32,688
It is you, to you alone...

744
01:28:33,897 --> 01:28:37,484
that I owe the few moments of happiness
I have known in this world.

745
01:28:41,405 --> 01:28:45,200
My destiny is more powerful than my will.

746
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:53,292
And my affections must yield
to the interests of my people.

747
01:29:14,396 --> 01:29:18,275
The imperial decree
for the dissolution of the marriage...

748
01:29:19,234 --> 01:29:23,155
between the Emperor Napoleon
and the Empress Joséphine.

749
01:29:31,622 --> 01:29:37,336
"My people desire that this throne,
where providence has placed me,

750
01:29:37,419 --> 01:29:39,338
would be given to my children.

751
01:29:40,881 --> 01:29:44,968
However, I have lost hope
of having children from my marriage

752
01:29:45,052 --> 01:29:47,846
to my beloved wife, Empress Joséphine.

753
01:29:48,805 --> 01:29:52,851
I have then been led to listen
only to the good of the State

754
01:29:52,935 --> 01:29:56,438
and to want the dissolution
of years of my life."

755
01:30:03,487 --> 01:30:08,242
You have embellished my life for 15 years.

756
01:30:10,369 --> 01:30:15,958
The memories of which will remain
forever etched in my heart.

757
01:30:32,099 --> 01:30:36,019
"Our marriage has become an obstacle
for the prosperity of France.

758
01:30:38,689 --> 01:30:40,274
She has been deprived...

759
01:30:41,984 --> 01:30:44,528
of one day being governed
by the descendants

760
01:30:44,653 --> 01:30:47,030
of the man brought to us by providence

761
01:30:47,114 --> 01:30:50,117
to mend the evils of a terrible revolution

762
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:53,829
and restore faith, the throne,
and the social order."

763
01:30:59,710 --> 01:31:00,752
Sorry.

764
01:31:02,838 --> 01:31:05,507
-Emperor. Wait.
-Go. No, listen. All right?

765
01:31:05,591 --> 01:31:08,802
This is for your country.
That's what this is, all right?

766
01:31:08,886 --> 01:31:10,012
Now say it.

767
01:31:11,180 --> 01:31:12,055
Say it.

768
01:31:19,354 --> 01:31:22,399
"Our marriage has become an obstacle
for the prosperity of France.

769
01:31:24,276 --> 01:31:27,404
Agreeing to the dissolution
of our marriage,

770
01:31:27,487 --> 01:31:30,032
as I must, does not change my feelings.

771
01:31:36,163 --> 01:31:42,503
The emperor will have in me
always his truest friend."

772
01:32:16,620 --> 01:32:17,621
Emperor,

773
01:32:18,455 --> 01:32:22,000
you have just pronounced the word
which separates us forever.

774
01:32:23,669 --> 01:32:26,171
Your mistaken ambition has ever been...

775
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:30,968
and will continue to be,
the guide of all your actions.

776
01:32:31,802 --> 01:32:32,886
Nevertheless...

777
01:32:33,929 --> 01:32:37,850
you can never doubt the sincerity
of my wishes for your happiness.

778
01:32:38,559 --> 01:32:42,187
May it at least afford me
some consolation for my sufferings.

779
01:32:43,355 --> 01:32:44,356
Yours...

780
01:32:44,439 --> 01:32:45,274
Thank you.

781
01:32:45,357 --> 01:32:46,483
...Joséphine.

782
01:32:46,608 --> 01:32:48,944
-Good morning, madame.
-Thank you. What's your name?

783
01:32:49,027 --> 01:32:51,154
-Fleur.
-Fleur. Pleasure.

784
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:54,801
I miss you.

785
01:34:00,224 --> 01:34:02,351
Marital life is very agreeable now.

786
01:34:06,939 --> 01:34:09,399
You've shown such great courage so far.

787
01:34:11,777 --> 01:34:13,362
You must maintain it.

788
01:34:14,821 --> 01:34:17,783
Do not permit yourself
to fall into melancholy.

789
01:34:23,288 --> 01:34:25,290
You look best when you're happy.

790
01:34:29,878 --> 01:34:31,296
Please take care of your health.

791
01:34:32,422 --> 01:34:33,799
It is precious to me.

792
01:34:35,175 --> 01:34:36,426
Will you write me tomorrow?

793
01:34:40,764 --> 01:34:41,974
And the next day?

794
01:34:42,766 --> 01:34:43,767
Yes.

795
01:34:44,726 --> 01:34:46,061
And the day after that?

796
01:34:49,773 --> 01:34:51,149
And the day after that?

797
01:34:55,195 --> 01:34:56,029
Good.

798
01:35:06,248 --> 01:35:09,960
Once, an English ambassador
challenged my reasons for war.

799
01:35:10,752 --> 01:35:14,131
He said, "You French,
you fight only for money,

800
01:35:14,214 --> 01:35:16,592
while we English, we fight for honor."

801
01:35:17,718 --> 01:35:21,430
I replied,
"Everyone fights for what they lack."

802
01:35:24,683 --> 01:35:27,603
This is not your story.
This never happened to you, did it?

803
01:35:27,686 --> 01:35:28,770
Of course it did.

804
01:35:28,854 --> 01:35:30,105
-Of course it did.
-What?

805
01:35:30,189 --> 01:35:32,774
We had the same saying
with my people and the Turks.

806
01:35:32,858 --> 01:35:33,692
Do you?

807
01:35:33,775 --> 01:35:35,819
The English lack honor.
We can agree on that.

808
01:35:35,903 --> 01:35:37,070
Listen, there is...

809
01:35:39,364 --> 01:35:41,783
There's nothing
I think we can agree more with...

810
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:44,786
than our hatred for Britain.

811
01:35:47,748 --> 01:35:49,499
I just have to say that...

812
01:35:51,210 --> 01:35:52,294
it actually...

813
01:35:52,836 --> 01:35:55,839
It would be my absolute pleasure and honor
if I could call you my brother.

814
01:35:59,551 --> 01:36:01,595
There is a way for you to call me brother.

815
01:36:04,181 --> 01:36:07,017
Last night, at dinner, I was...

816
01:36:09,186 --> 01:36:11,480
charmed by your sister.

817
01:36:13,106 --> 01:36:14,233
Is she spoken for?

818
01:36:15,484 --> 01:36:19,905
Sadly, yes. She's to be married
to the Duke of Oldenburg, I'm afraid.

819
01:36:20,614 --> 01:36:23,158
And what of her younger sister? Anna?

820
01:36:24,368 --> 01:36:26,078
Is there a formal offer for Anna?

821
01:36:33,919 --> 01:36:36,588
Well, you see, Anna, she's 15 years old.

822
01:36:37,714 --> 01:36:38,882
That is a detail.

823
01:36:42,344 --> 01:36:46,974
Our friendship is built
on our mutual distrust of England.

824
01:36:47,641 --> 01:36:51,937
When we hold to the Continental blockade,
we choke them from the trade,

825
01:36:52,020 --> 01:36:54,439
and we fight for our most sacred rights.

826
01:36:54,523 --> 01:36:58,318
That is what is important between us.
I've just had a thought.

827
01:36:59,027 --> 01:37:00,362
-No.
-No, say it.

828
01:37:00,445 --> 01:37:02,072
-Should I tell you?
-Please.

829
01:37:03,282 --> 01:37:06,451
Imagine an army. Fifty thousand men.

830
01:37:06,535 --> 01:37:09,705
Russians, Frenchmen,
perhaps even Austrians,

831
01:37:09,788 --> 01:37:12,416
marching
by way of Constantinople into Asia

832
01:37:12,541 --> 01:37:14,209
would have only to reach the Euphrates

833
01:37:14,293 --> 01:37:16,879
to make England tremble
and bring her down on her knees

834
01:37:16,962 --> 01:37:18,213
before the Continent.

835
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:23,093
It is incredible.

836
01:37:24,344 --> 01:37:25,345
Toast.

837
01:37:32,060 --> 01:37:33,604
-To you.
-To us.

838
01:37:34,771 --> 01:37:39,651
His Majesty the Emperor Napoleon
wishes to make a formal offer to Austria

839
01:37:39,735 --> 01:37:42,112
and to His Majesty King Francis...

840
01:37:43,238 --> 01:37:46,617
for the hand
of the Archduchess Marie Louise.

841
01:37:48,118 --> 01:37:49,369
His eldest daughter.

842
01:37:53,081 --> 01:37:55,667
This union would bring together
Austria and France

843
01:37:55,751 --> 01:37:58,003
in an unbreakable matrimonial bond.

844
01:37:59,296 --> 01:38:00,714
Is this a joke?

845
01:38:04,051 --> 01:38:10,641
I may find it humorous...
but His Majesty does not.

846
01:38:28,825 --> 01:38:30,327
Did you have a pleasant journey?

847
01:38:30,410 --> 01:38:32,246
It was wonderful. Thank you.

848
01:38:38,126 --> 01:38:39,378
You're quite petite.

849
01:38:40,629 --> 01:38:41,880
I'm not accustomed to that.

850
01:38:45,801 --> 01:38:47,052
How do I look to you?

851
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:50,430
Do I resemble my portrait?

852
01:38:51,014 --> 01:38:52,057
Oh, yes.

853
01:38:52,599 --> 01:38:55,394
And even more handsome and strong.

854
01:38:56,645 --> 01:39:00,190
And you are even more handsome.
More beautiful.

855
01:39:02,317 --> 01:39:04,611
I hope you're pleased with your choice.

856
01:39:05,863 --> 01:39:09,032
I hope so too.
Would you like to see the bedroom?

857
01:39:09,950 --> 01:39:11,493
Yes, thank you.

858
01:39:23,797 --> 01:39:26,008
Your Majesty? Your son.

859
01:39:45,319 --> 01:39:46,320
Hello.

860
01:39:50,741 --> 01:39:51,825
Fire!

861
01:40:00,459 --> 01:40:01,752
My little king.

862
01:41:14,324 --> 01:41:16,285
Oh, sweet child.

863
01:41:26,670 --> 01:41:27,713
One day...

864
01:41:29,381 --> 01:41:32,467
you will understand
what I have sacrificed for you.

865
01:41:42,311 --> 01:41:45,314
My dear Joséphine, I'm sad today.

866
01:41:45,856 --> 01:41:49,860
Tsar Alexander has turned against me
and forced me to invade Russia.

867
01:41:50,611 --> 01:41:53,530
He's decided
to open his ports to England,

868
01:41:53,614 --> 01:41:55,490
while taxing the French.

869
01:41:56,867 --> 01:42:00,454
I must wipe away my melancholy
and begin the march to Moscow.

870
01:42:01,580 --> 01:42:04,499
I've convinced the heads of Europe
of this resolution,

871
01:42:04,583 --> 01:42:09,046
and so I command the combined forces
of France, Austria, Italy,

872
01:42:09,129 --> 01:42:11,215
Germany, and Poland.

873
01:42:11,298 --> 01:42:14,176
I see nothing but success in my future.

874
01:42:14,718 --> 01:42:17,054
Keep your lines. Steady.

875
01:42:19,223 --> 01:42:20,516
To the front.

876
01:42:21,225 --> 01:42:22,893
Keep your step.

877
01:42:29,483 --> 01:42:31,568
-Take cover!
-Get down!

878
01:42:38,033 --> 01:42:39,826
Get down! Get down!

879
01:42:53,006 --> 01:42:55,092
After them! After them!

880
01:43:36,341 --> 01:43:39,970
-Get back! Drop back. Retreat.
-Fall back!

881
01:44:47,329 --> 01:44:48,914
My dear Joséphine...

882
01:44:50,791 --> 01:44:54,211
I'm writing to you because I have won
a great battle today.

883
01:44:55,754 --> 01:44:58,674
Tomorrow we will resume our advance.

884
01:44:58,757 --> 01:45:01,134
Moscow is now only 200 miles away.

885
01:45:01,218 --> 01:45:04,680
And I think of you all the while.
All yours.

886
01:45:05,305 --> 01:45:06,306
Nearly there.

887
01:45:14,565 --> 01:45:15,566
Thank you, sir.

888
01:45:22,781 --> 01:45:25,492
-Thank you, emperor.
-You are the brave of Austerlitz.

889
01:46:30,724 --> 01:46:31,892
Where are you?!

890
01:46:45,364 --> 01:46:47,699
Three hundred thousand souls
lived in this city.

891
01:46:49,493 --> 01:46:50,994
And they've all just left?

892
01:47:10,097 --> 01:47:12,599
Little boy.

893
01:47:18,230 --> 01:47:19,439
Where are you?

894
01:47:24,111 --> 01:47:25,696
Don't be frightened.

895
01:47:26,738 --> 01:47:29,241
I'm just gonna give you a little spanking.

896
01:47:59,730 --> 01:48:01,315
It's not very sporting, is it?

897
01:48:03,192 --> 01:48:05,402
For his honor and Russia's, not mine.

898
01:48:10,365 --> 01:48:12,242
There's dignity to be had in defeat.

899
01:48:55,994 --> 01:48:57,037
Who did this?

900
01:48:58,455 --> 01:48:59,456
They did.

901
01:49:00,999 --> 01:49:04,795
No, they did not. Be sensible.

902
01:49:07,089 --> 01:49:08,423
Who set these fires?

903
01:49:10,217 --> 01:49:11,426
Your Majesty...

904
01:49:13,053 --> 01:49:14,054
they did.

905
01:49:19,518 --> 01:49:22,312
He'd rather burn his own city
than negotiate with me.

906
01:49:23,063 --> 01:49:25,065
I didn't think he had the courage.

907
01:49:30,612 --> 01:49:36,201
Well, we'll go to St. Petersburg
and have him burn that too.

908
01:49:38,537 --> 01:49:41,582
We have let too much time slip away.

909
01:49:43,375 --> 01:49:46,587
We would be marching
into the Russian winter...

910
01:49:47,671 --> 01:49:51,717
with horses that are not raised
for this weather.

911
01:49:53,218 --> 01:49:56,638
If we go back to Poland,
we can wait out the winter months.

912
01:50:12,070 --> 01:50:15,324
Napoleon, your letters are
a soothing balm to my heart.

913
01:50:16,366 --> 01:50:17,534
I fear for you.

914
01:50:18,452 --> 01:50:22,039
Remember that I alone
know your health, your fears.

915
01:50:22,998 --> 01:50:26,376
I thank you as tenderly
as I will always love you.

916
01:50:27,085 --> 01:50:28,086
Joséphine.

917
01:50:29,796 --> 01:50:31,340
My friend, Joséphine.

918
01:50:32,591 --> 01:50:33,717
"Friend."

919
01:50:34,801 --> 01:50:37,137
It is strange to write that word to you.

920
01:50:38,138 --> 01:50:40,182
You have always been so much more.

921
01:50:48,315 --> 01:50:53,111
Despite careful organization,
there have been breakdowns in supply.

922
01:50:54,780 --> 01:50:59,535
We're suffering sickness,
desertion and famine.

923
01:51:01,537 --> 01:51:02,704
We are winning.

924
01:51:14,883 --> 01:51:18,220
-That us or Cossacks?
-Us.

925
01:51:21,431 --> 01:51:22,641
Joséphine.

926
01:51:24,268 --> 01:51:26,144
Fortune has abandoned me.

927
01:51:27,229 --> 01:51:29,690
I know that it is what fate has for me.

928
01:51:30,691 --> 01:51:32,776
Your words rattle in my head.

929
01:51:34,444 --> 01:51:36,238
I am nothing without you.

930
01:51:40,784 --> 01:51:44,496
Of the 600,000 men you sent to Russia,

931
01:51:44,580 --> 01:51:46,790
only 40,000 have returned.

932
01:51:47,583 --> 01:51:50,043
Therefore, you have been exiled...

933
01:51:51,587 --> 01:51:53,046
in no uncertain terms.

934
01:51:55,007 --> 01:51:59,761
The allied coalition of Austria,
Prussia, Russia, and England...

935
01:52:01,722 --> 01:52:04,099
and with the agreement
of the French Council...

936
01:52:05,225 --> 01:52:08,729
grant you sovereignty
of the island of Elba.

937
01:52:10,689 --> 01:52:13,901
A revenue of 2 million francs
from the French funds...

938
01:52:14,818 --> 01:52:18,155
pensions for the Bonaparte family
and the Empress Marie Louise.

939
01:52:19,323 --> 01:52:24,494
It also provides for Empress Joséphine
to retain all of her properties...

940
01:52:26,038 --> 01:52:29,917
and an allotted annual income
of 1 million francs.

941
01:52:59,029 --> 01:53:00,656
I love France too much.

942
01:53:05,994 --> 01:53:08,121
All I've desired was its glory.

943
01:53:10,958 --> 01:53:13,085
I would never bring her misfortune.

944
01:53:15,462 --> 01:53:17,005
They want me to abdicate.

945
01:53:18,757 --> 01:53:20,259
Fine, I'll abdicate.

946
01:54:27,034 --> 01:54:28,076
Your Highness.

947
01:54:29,786 --> 01:54:30,787
Empress.

948
01:54:45,886 --> 01:54:46,887
Here.

949
01:54:51,600 --> 01:54:53,435
Joséphine, Joséphine.

950
01:54:55,646 --> 01:54:56,647
I am charmed.

951
01:54:58,690 --> 01:54:59,691
But...

952
01:55:04,321 --> 01:55:08,408
you do not have to lock yourself away
just because he's not here.

953
01:55:10,160 --> 01:55:12,746
I know what it is like
to be underestimated.

954
01:55:14,289 --> 01:55:15,541
But your eyes,

955
01:55:16,834 --> 01:55:18,043
your charm...

956
01:55:19,127 --> 01:55:20,295
and your spirit...

957
01:55:21,505 --> 01:55:22,673
it is in there.

958
01:55:23,549 --> 01:55:27,052
It is yours, and you can use it.

959
01:56:11,054 --> 01:56:12,347
Dear Joséphine.

960
01:56:13,223 --> 01:56:16,351
You are mine. You will always be.

961
01:56:17,853 --> 01:56:19,771
I cannot stand it any longer.

962
01:56:20,564 --> 01:56:22,774
It has been 300 days on this rock,

963
01:56:23,358 --> 01:56:26,695
and I'm ready to come home
and reclaim what's mine:

964
01:56:27,404 --> 01:56:29,198
You and France.

965
01:56:47,382 --> 01:56:48,717
I'm taking your ship.

966
01:56:49,176 --> 01:56:52,304
If you do not provoke me,
you do not have to fear me.

967
01:57:11,073 --> 01:57:12,157
Napoleon...

968
01:57:13,283 --> 01:57:17,496
I'm a flower that opens its petals
and smiles to the sunshine...

969
01:57:18,497 --> 01:57:22,251
unconscious that the storm is near
which will lay me low

970
01:57:22,334 --> 01:57:24,378
and scatter leaves to the heavens.

971
01:57:25,337 --> 01:57:27,256
Come quickly, my friend.

972
01:57:56,952 --> 01:57:59,371
If you would open your mouth, please.

973
01:58:04,626 --> 01:58:05,627
Thank you.

974
01:58:10,507 --> 01:58:11,508
Thank you.

975
01:58:12,551 --> 01:58:15,929
Well, your chest is congested.
Your throat is aflame.

976
01:58:16,972 --> 01:58:18,891
My suggestion is to stay in bed.

977
01:58:21,310 --> 01:58:22,811
But Napoleon is coming.

978
01:58:23,312 --> 01:58:25,981
It would be unwise
to receive any visitors.

979
01:58:26,064 --> 01:58:27,649
But Napoleon is coming.

980
01:58:27,774 --> 01:58:28,859
I understand.

981
01:58:48,378 --> 01:58:50,297
Just keep her comfortable.

982
01:59:18,325 --> 01:59:19,368
Your Majesty.

983
01:59:24,206 --> 01:59:24,998
You may speak.

984
01:59:25,582 --> 01:59:28,585
Bonaparte, Your Majesty. He has returned.

985
01:59:28,669 --> 01:59:30,754
A ship landed on the beach
in Antibes this morning.

986
01:59:30,838 --> 01:59:31,839
They're on the march.

987
01:59:31,922 --> 01:59:34,967
Napoleon Bonaparte
is marching towards Paris.

988
01:59:38,345 --> 01:59:40,514
-More.
-Your Majesty.

989
02:00:14,089 --> 02:00:15,340
Afternoon, colonel.

990
02:00:16,049 --> 02:00:17,301
Your Majesty.

991
02:00:17,885 --> 02:00:18,927
General Marchand,

992
02:00:19,011 --> 02:00:21,763
in defense of the royal government
of King Louis XVIII,

993
02:00:22,306 --> 02:00:25,434
requests that you surrender your weapons
and cease your march,

994
02:00:26,226 --> 02:00:28,562
so that you may be arrested
and returned to your island.

995
02:00:29,813 --> 02:00:33,775
Will you please inform the general that
I shall like to come and speak with him?

996
02:00:35,402 --> 02:00:37,696
I have no fight with my own Fifth Army.

997
02:00:39,281 --> 02:00:40,282
Sir.

998
02:00:49,291 --> 02:00:50,792
He wishes to speak.

999
02:00:52,211 --> 02:00:53,212
Make ready!

1000
02:00:57,508 --> 02:00:58,550
Present.

1001
02:01:09,228 --> 02:01:11,438
Soldiers of the Fifth Regiment,

1002
02:01:12,981 --> 02:01:14,274
do you recognize me?

1003
02:01:17,986 --> 02:01:19,863
Do you recognize me, soldiers?

1004
02:01:22,032 --> 02:01:23,617
Yes, Emperor!

1005
02:01:29,790 --> 02:01:30,832
I miss you.

1006
02:01:33,836 --> 02:01:35,879
I'm melancholy for my home...

1007
02:01:38,006 --> 02:01:39,800
and for our victories together.

1008
02:01:43,595 --> 02:01:45,055
I want to come home.

1009
02:01:46,390 --> 02:01:47,766
Will you join me?

1010
02:01:49,476 --> 02:01:51,311
Long live the emperor!

1011
02:01:51,395 --> 02:01:54,565
-Long live the emperor!
-Long live the emperor!

1012
02:01:54,648 --> 02:01:58,777
-Long live the emperor!
-Long live the emperor!

1013
02:02:02,948 --> 02:02:04,825
Long live the emperor!

1014
02:02:05,534 --> 02:02:06,994
Long live the emperor!

1015
02:02:11,081 --> 02:02:13,417
Long live the emperor!

1016
02:02:15,711 --> 02:02:17,212
Long live the emperor!

1017
02:02:38,775 --> 02:02:43,614
On May 26th, Dr. Corvisart was called...

1018
02:02:44,823 --> 02:02:50,120
and found her chest congested
and her throat inflamed.

1019
02:02:52,414 --> 02:02:54,917
Her illness was diphtheria.

1020
02:02:58,086 --> 02:02:59,421
On May 29th...

1021
02:03:01,673 --> 02:03:04,092
last sacrament was given and she died.

1022
02:03:08,597 --> 02:03:10,516
And no one thought to notify me?

1023
02:03:20,734 --> 02:03:21,777
Hortense.

1024
02:03:24,613 --> 02:03:25,614
Do you blame--?

1025
02:03:27,574 --> 02:03:28,659
Do you blame me?

1026
02:03:31,495 --> 02:03:32,621
I don't blame you.

1027
02:03:32,704 --> 02:03:33,747
Of course not.

1028
02:03:36,708 --> 02:03:39,628
I'm not to bear
the burden of responsibility...

1029
02:03:41,421 --> 02:03:43,549
for the misfortunes of your mother.

1030
02:03:44,550 --> 02:03:46,593
I want the letters that I wrote to her.

1031
02:03:46,677 --> 02:03:50,848
I'm sorry, I don't have them.
They were stolen by her valet.

1032
02:03:53,559 --> 02:03:54,977
Where did she keep them?

1033
02:03:57,145 --> 02:03:59,690
In the cupboard in her bedroom,
next to her bed.

1034
02:04:03,277 --> 02:04:04,820
What did he do with them?

1035
02:04:07,072 --> 02:04:08,740
Her valet sold them.

1036
02:04:16,164 --> 02:04:17,332
I'm sorry.

1037
02:04:19,960 --> 02:04:21,044
I forgive you.

1038
02:04:25,883 --> 02:04:28,969
Napoleon Bonaparte has destroyed

1039
02:04:29,052 --> 02:04:33,056
the only title upon which
his very existence depended.

1040
02:04:34,349 --> 02:04:37,603
This congregation of allies shall form

1041
02:04:37,686 --> 02:04:41,273
along the borders of France
and Belgium an army.

1042
02:04:41,815 --> 02:04:44,193
Seventy thousand troops from England...

1043
02:04:45,360 --> 02:04:47,779
120,000 troops from Prussia.

1044
02:04:49,990 --> 02:04:53,994
This vermin has routed
the farmyards of Europe...

1045
02:04:54,912 --> 02:04:56,872
while the farmers snored.

1046
02:04:57,581 --> 02:05:00,042
We should have struck this blow long ago.

1047
02:05:00,918 --> 02:05:05,214
He has held the world hostage
with his egotism,

1048
02:05:05,297 --> 02:05:08,550
his insatiable hunger for power,

1049
02:05:09,176 --> 02:05:12,012
and his lack of simple good manners.

1050
02:05:12,930 --> 02:05:15,516
We will all sleep again without him.

1051
02:05:16,642 --> 02:05:21,772
I believe I speak for all of us when I say
that the only regret we all share

1052
02:05:22,397 --> 02:05:25,776
is that we allowed this vermin
to live at all.

1053
02:05:27,194 --> 02:05:30,656
Two hundred and fifty thousand men
with the traitor.

1054
02:05:32,407 --> 02:05:37,621
Twenty-five thousand men,
125,000 men,

1055
02:05:38,455 --> 02:05:40,123
and 100,000 men...

1056
02:05:44,127 --> 02:05:47,422
against our 125,000 men.

1057
02:05:49,925 --> 02:05:51,468
This is a fight on land.

1058
02:05:53,136 --> 02:05:56,473
This is what Britain does not know
how to do that I know.

1059
02:05:58,392 --> 02:06:02,354
Strike quickly
against Wellington and Blücher.

1060
02:06:03,313 --> 02:06:04,857
Defeat them separately.

1061
02:06:05,983 --> 02:06:09,486
Disallow them from uniting forces here.

1062
02:06:22,416 --> 02:06:24,293
-Morning.
-Morning.

1063
02:06:25,794 --> 02:06:27,546
The Prussians are advancing.

1064
02:06:28,255 --> 02:06:29,882
We should begin the offensive.

1065
02:06:30,716 --> 02:06:32,426
We must wait for the ground to dry.

1066
02:06:35,179 --> 02:06:38,307
Blücher will never make it in time.
I'll have Wellington by lunch.

1067
02:07:01,246 --> 02:07:03,624
I never get wet if I can help it.

1068
02:08:10,148 --> 02:08:11,441
What shall I tell the men?

1069
02:08:13,443 --> 02:08:15,195
Tell them to make the rain stop.

1070
02:08:18,323 --> 02:08:22,619
-Coming through!
-In formation!

1071
02:08:24,162 --> 02:08:26,748
Now's your time, lads. Now's your time.

1072
02:08:28,166 --> 02:08:29,543
Listen very carefully.

1073
02:08:31,128 --> 02:08:36,133
Patience is the order of the day today.
Patience shall win the day.

1074
02:08:36,925 --> 02:08:39,261
We must hold this ground.

1075
02:08:39,928 --> 02:08:41,388
Let him come to us!

1076
02:08:48,854 --> 02:08:50,105
Go on, boys. Go on.

1077
02:08:54,067 --> 02:08:55,444
Good morning, General Blücher.

1078
02:08:55,527 --> 02:08:57,946
-Good morning.
-Estimated time of arrival, sir?

1079
02:08:58,030 --> 02:09:00,407
-Officer?
-About five hours.

1080
02:09:00,490 --> 02:09:02,117
About five hours.

1081
02:09:18,800 --> 02:09:20,010
Come on, boys. Come on, boys!

1082
02:09:32,648 --> 02:09:33,815
There he is.

1083
02:09:34,775 --> 02:09:36,610
He appears to be...

1084
02:09:38,320 --> 02:09:40,322
just sleeping.

1085
02:09:41,990 --> 02:09:47,412
But the one thing you cannot resist,
my friend, is a frontal attack.

1086
02:09:50,374 --> 02:09:53,335
Let's see how this general
can attack our position.

1087
02:09:56,255 --> 02:10:01,134
Sir. I have the emperor in my sights.
Do I have permission to fire?

1088
02:10:01,218 --> 02:10:02,261
Certainly not.

1089
02:10:02,970 --> 02:10:05,430
Generals commanding armies
have better things to do

1090
02:10:05,514 --> 02:10:06,807
than to shoot at one another.

1091
02:10:06,890 --> 02:10:08,809
Hold your fire, rifleman,
on pain of death.

1092
02:10:08,892 --> 02:10:12,521
-Go on, boys. Come, come!
-A runner coming through!

1093
02:10:14,147 --> 02:10:15,732
Blücher, 11 to 12 miles, sir.

1094
02:10:16,525 --> 02:10:18,151
Attention. Follow me.

1095
02:10:18,777 --> 02:10:21,405
-Blücher at 11 to 12 miles, sir.
-Jesus Christ.

1096
02:10:21,488 --> 02:10:23,574
-I want a report every hour.
-Yes, sir.

1097
02:10:26,869 --> 02:10:30,038
Runner coming through! Make way!

1098
02:10:34,626 --> 02:10:37,546
Prussians on the roadside, 12 miles.

1099
02:10:43,886 --> 02:10:48,140
Prussian troops have been sighted
on the road, sire. Twelve miles.

1100
02:10:51,476 --> 02:10:52,561
Ready the cannons.

1101
02:10:56,148 --> 02:10:58,025
Ready the cannons!

1102
02:11:01,028 --> 02:11:03,071
Go on! Move!

1103
02:11:12,497 --> 02:11:15,000
Ready! Cannons are ready!

1104
02:11:15,083 --> 02:11:17,085
Cannons are ready!

1105
02:11:17,169 --> 02:11:18,754
The rain has stopped, sir.

1106
02:11:27,679 --> 02:11:29,431
Prepare to fire!

1107
02:11:39,024 --> 02:11:41,693
-Fire!
-Fire!

1108
02:11:47,699 --> 02:11:49,201
Take cover!

1109
02:11:52,037 --> 02:11:54,331
Straight into position. Steady.

1110
02:11:54,957 --> 02:11:58,377
Prepare for the advance! Get ready!

1111
02:11:59,837 --> 02:12:01,338
Prepare for the advance.

1112
02:12:01,421 --> 02:12:03,507
Readjust to 1-9-5!

1113
02:12:03,590 --> 02:12:05,551
Adjust 1-9-5!

1114
02:12:05,634 --> 02:12:08,512
Elevation 1-9-5.

1115
02:12:11,390 --> 02:12:12,558
Adjusted!

1116
02:12:14,434 --> 02:12:17,312
Prepare to fire! Fire!

1117
02:12:17,396 --> 02:12:18,397
Fire!

1118
02:12:24,152 --> 02:12:27,322
Keep your heads down. Take cover!

1119
02:12:36,123 --> 02:12:38,750
-Out the way!
-Hold fast, men!

1120
02:12:43,005 --> 02:12:46,675
Infantry, advance!

1121
02:12:47,384 --> 02:12:48,886
Left company!

1122
02:12:51,346 --> 02:12:52,931
And march!

1123
02:12:53,015 --> 02:12:55,267
Get in formation. Now!

1124
02:12:57,019 --> 02:12:58,187
Keep the line!

1125
02:12:59,563 --> 02:13:00,564
Join!

1126
02:13:09,907 --> 02:13:14,077
-Second wave, advance!
-Over the top, men!

1127
02:13:14,912 --> 02:13:16,371
Form line!

1128
02:13:16,455 --> 02:13:18,415
Cannons!

1129
02:13:19,082 --> 02:13:20,876
Fire!

1130
02:13:24,171 --> 02:13:25,255
Make ready!

1131
02:13:26,882 --> 02:13:28,133
Hold fast!

1132
02:13:29,009 --> 02:13:30,385
Fire!

1133
02:13:39,728 --> 02:13:41,688
You there, get on that cannon.

1134
02:13:51,907 --> 02:13:53,075
Fire!

1135
02:14:00,415 --> 02:14:01,500
Fill the gap!

1136
02:14:03,460 --> 02:14:04,962
Keep the line!

1137
02:14:12,511 --> 02:14:14,930
Skirmishers, keep advancing!

1138
02:14:15,013 --> 02:14:16,515
Get in formation.

1139
02:14:16,640 --> 02:14:18,100
Fire at will!

1140
02:14:23,647 --> 02:14:26,024
Keep them back, men. Fire!

1141
02:14:29,194 --> 02:14:32,364
Go on, go on. Don't let them rally!

1142
02:14:36,618 --> 02:14:39,288
Get that gun back in strike position!

1143
02:14:39,371 --> 02:14:41,999
Get up, boys! Go on. Go on, boys!

1144
02:14:47,421 --> 02:14:50,382
Prussians, roadside, five miles.

1145
02:14:51,967 --> 02:14:53,427
Five miles, maybe less.

1146
02:14:55,554 --> 02:14:57,806
We have to act before Blücher arrives.

1147
02:14:57,890 --> 02:14:58,891
Out.

1148
02:15:01,810 --> 02:15:02,811
Out!

1149
02:15:14,907 --> 02:15:16,450
Cavalry!

1150
02:15:17,659 --> 02:15:19,536
Charge!

1151
02:15:26,460 --> 02:15:28,003
Prepare to receive cavalry.

1152
02:15:28,086 --> 02:15:30,756
Prepare to receive cavalry!

1153
02:15:39,723 --> 02:15:43,602
We must hold our ground.
Stand fast to the last man.

1154
02:15:43,685 --> 02:15:45,854
We must not be beat!

1155
02:15:46,772 --> 02:15:48,982
Or what will they say in England?

1156
02:15:49,066 --> 02:15:52,236
-Hold the line!
-Keep tight!

1157
02:15:56,573 --> 02:16:00,118
-Steady, men!
-Stay in formation.

1158
02:16:03,497 --> 02:16:05,874
Long live the emperor!

1159
02:16:08,168 --> 02:16:10,170
Company, halt!

1160
02:16:10,796 --> 02:16:14,174
Form square! Form square!

1161
02:16:29,815 --> 02:16:32,442
Long live the emperor!

1162
02:16:35,529 --> 02:16:39,449
One section, fire. Two section, fire.

1163
02:16:53,755 --> 02:16:55,507
Hold that line! Fire!

1164
02:16:55,591 --> 02:16:58,510
What do we do, sir?
We can't break through.

1165
02:16:58,594 --> 02:17:01,013
-Keep them running.
-Get them back in the square!

1166
02:17:03,223 --> 02:17:05,309
Show them your British steel.

1167
02:17:17,154 --> 02:17:18,906
Present arms!

1168
02:17:22,659 --> 02:17:24,286
Shoulder arms!

1169
02:17:28,707 --> 02:17:30,584
They're here, the Prussians.

1170
02:17:33,754 --> 02:17:35,589
First over the rise, emperor.

1171
02:18:01,156 --> 02:18:03,242
We need to find a way through!

1172
02:18:06,078 --> 02:18:08,080
-Break the square.
-Break the square!

1173
02:18:18,590 --> 02:18:20,008
Charge bayonets.

1174
02:18:20,801 --> 02:18:22,845
Charge bayonets!

1175
02:18:24,680 --> 02:18:29,059
Your emperor is with you!
You are the brave of Austerlitz!

1176
02:18:30,227 --> 02:18:31,728
Never surrender!

1177
02:18:32,563 --> 02:18:34,982
For homeland and glory!

1178
02:18:41,947 --> 02:18:44,616
Shoulder to shoulder! Form lines!

1179
02:18:44,700 --> 02:18:46,034
Shoulder to shoulder.

1180
02:18:53,417 --> 02:18:55,085
Infantry, advance.

1181
02:18:55,169 --> 02:18:58,547
Battalion and infantry!

1182
02:18:58,630 --> 02:19:01,049
Advance!

1183
02:19:06,763 --> 02:19:07,973
Keep the line!

1184
02:19:10,392 --> 02:19:12,769
First rank, fire!

1185
02:19:16,523 --> 02:19:18,775
Second rank, fire!

1186
02:19:22,571 --> 02:19:24,406
Prepare to charge!

1187
02:19:26,366 --> 02:19:27,743
Charge!

1188
02:19:34,541 --> 02:19:36,710
Go on! Batter them!

1189
02:19:38,670 --> 02:19:41,340
Advance! Advance!

1190
02:19:53,060 --> 02:19:54,478
Cavalry advance, sir?

1191
02:19:55,604 --> 02:19:56,855
Cavalry advance.

1192
02:20:03,028 --> 02:20:04,696
Full support!

1193
02:20:39,690 --> 02:20:43,485
No. He can't help himself.

1194
02:20:44,736 --> 02:20:46,405
Sir, Blücher.

1195
02:20:53,287 --> 02:20:54,538
Thank God.

1196
02:20:54,621 --> 02:20:56,999
Your Majesty!

1197
02:20:57,916 --> 02:20:59,585
Your Majesty!

1198
02:21:00,836 --> 02:21:03,630
Come see how a Marshal of France dies!

1199
02:22:09,321 --> 02:22:13,951
The battle is mine.
There will be an end to the war.

1200
02:22:21,542 --> 02:22:23,043
Senior officer, on deck!

1201
02:22:25,921 --> 02:22:27,965
Good day. Good day. Good day.

1202
02:22:31,051 --> 02:22:33,303
I am the first to admit
when I make a mistake.

1203
02:22:34,638 --> 02:22:35,806
But I never do.

1204
02:22:36,473 --> 02:22:38,267
Because it is geometry.

1205
02:22:39,726 --> 02:22:42,604
I simply know precisely
where to place a cannon.

1206
02:22:43,772 --> 02:22:48,402
But, tragically, I cannot transfer
this knowledge to my marshals.

1207
02:22:49,361 --> 02:22:52,489
That might be
what is most difficult in life.

1208
02:22:54,533 --> 02:22:56,368
Accepting the failures of others.

1209
02:22:57,411 --> 02:22:58,704
You must not do that.

1210
02:23:01,290 --> 02:23:02,583
Encourage greatness.

1211
02:23:07,713 --> 02:23:08,922
Mind your head, sir.

1212
02:23:11,967 --> 02:23:13,218
Mind your head, sir.

1213
02:23:20,767 --> 02:23:23,896
-What are they doing there?
-Sir, it's the midshipmen. They adore him.

1214
02:23:24,021 --> 02:23:24,980
Get them out.

1215
02:23:25,564 --> 02:23:27,191
Clear the room. Quickly.

1216
02:23:43,457 --> 02:23:45,501
-Your Grace--
-Good morning, general.

1217
02:23:45,584 --> 02:23:47,169
These boys are delightful.

1218
02:23:48,670 --> 02:23:50,631
-May I sit down?
-Please.

1219
02:23:52,424 --> 02:23:53,634
And this breakfast.

1220
02:23:54,718 --> 02:23:57,179
Now I know why you have
such a successful navy.

1221
02:23:58,222 --> 02:23:59,223
Thank you.

1222
02:24:04,853 --> 02:24:07,314
I've never visited
the English countryside.

1223
02:24:07,397 --> 02:24:09,399
I imagine I'll love the Cotswolds.

1224
02:24:12,778 --> 02:24:16,198
Soft rolling hills, gentle light.

1225
02:24:17,783 --> 02:24:22,120
My dear sir,
it is only by a narrow margin of opinion

1226
02:24:22,204 --> 02:24:24,498
that you have been spared
the fate of being shot.

1227
02:24:26,291 --> 02:24:28,544
Politically, I'm afraid it's impossible

1228
02:24:28,669 --> 02:24:32,005
for the British government
to allow you to stay in England.

1229
02:24:34,007 --> 02:24:37,010
You are permitted three officers
and 12 servants

1230
02:24:37,094 --> 02:24:39,429
to accompany you into exile.

1231
02:24:40,264 --> 02:24:43,934
Exile will be contained
to the island of Saint Helena,

1232
02:24:44,017 --> 02:24:48,522
under the watchful eye
of Governor Hudson Lowe and his family.

1233
02:24:50,899 --> 02:24:51,900
Saint...

1234
02:24:53,151 --> 02:24:53,986
Helena.

1235
02:24:55,153 --> 02:24:56,321
It's a small island.

1236
02:24:57,531 --> 02:24:58,949
More of a rock, really.

1237
02:25:00,117 --> 02:25:02,870
A thousand miles
from the mainland of Africa.

1238
02:25:03,579 --> 02:25:08,041
I'm told it's very pretty, tranquil.
You'll have time to reflect.

1239
02:25:09,751 --> 02:25:11,920
Your correspondence will be monitored,

1240
02:25:12,004 --> 02:25:15,591
your presence verified twice daily
by the orderly officer.

1241
02:25:25,851 --> 02:25:29,229
-Fix that rigging line.
-Draw in the sails!

1242
02:25:30,689 --> 02:25:31,899
Go below deck!

1243
02:25:41,116 --> 02:25:45,412
What will you do now?
I hate to see you alone.

1244
02:25:46,872 --> 02:25:48,290
Will you come to me?

1245
02:25:50,250 --> 02:25:51,627
Will I forgive you?

1246
02:25:53,337 --> 02:25:55,506
My sweet, stubborn emperor.

1247
02:25:56,798 --> 02:25:59,426
I let you loose and let you come to ruin.

1248
02:26:00,761 --> 02:26:05,807
Next time, I will be emperor
and you will do as I say.

1249
02:26:13,190 --> 02:26:15,984
Well, you were right.

1250
02:26:17,361 --> 02:26:19,905
Every night I beg to see you in my dreams.

1251
02:26:20,822 --> 02:26:24,076
And when I do, you turn me away.

1252
02:26:56,733 --> 02:26:58,944
Girls, what's the capital of France?

1253
02:27:01,029 --> 02:27:02,030
Paris.

1254
02:27:02,739 --> 02:27:03,740
And Russia?

1255
02:27:04,491 --> 02:27:06,827
Petersburg. And Moscow before.

1256
02:27:08,704 --> 02:27:09,746
Moscow.

1257
02:27:11,164 --> 02:27:13,250
And who burnt Moscow to the ground?

1258
02:27:17,421 --> 02:27:18,505
I don't know, sir.

1259
02:27:19,923 --> 02:27:20,924
I did.

1260
02:27:21,800 --> 02:27:26,054
I believe, sir, the Russians burnt it
to get rid of the French.

1261
02:27:26,138 --> 02:27:27,222
Who told you that?

1262
02:27:27,890 --> 02:27:29,558
It's common knowledge, sir.

1263
02:27:33,520 --> 02:27:35,856
Go. Go play.

1264
02:27:41,653 --> 02:27:44,198
Can I tell you
what I have waiting for you?

1265
02:27:46,366 --> 02:27:50,579
It is a secret.
And I will show you when you arrive.

1266
02:27:54,166 --> 02:27:56,043
Come to me, Napoleon.

1267
02:27:57,461 --> 02:27:59,588
And let's try this again.
