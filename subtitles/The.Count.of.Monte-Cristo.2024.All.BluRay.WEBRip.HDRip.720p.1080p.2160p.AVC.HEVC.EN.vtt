00:01:01.242 --> 00:01:04.417
1815 - Napoleon, removed from
power, took refuge on the island of Elba.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.917
While his followers dream of his return,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.317
the new royalist power hunts
them down mercilessly.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.100
Arrests and executions continue to spiral
in a climate of civil war.

00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:17.336
On a stormy night off the coast
of Cape Corso (Corsica),..

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.420
the merchant ship Pharaoh crosses
paths with a boat in danger...

00:02:47.042 --> 00:02:48.042
You saved her.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.875
Get me a blanket!

00:02:57.417 --> 00:02:58.833
I told you not to go!

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.833
You're grounded!
I don't want to see you until Marseille!

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:04.750
What?

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.795
Do you find me brutal?

00:03:07.375 --> 00:03:10.333
Not only do I know it,
but I take pride in it.

00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.042
Come on!

00:03:15.708 --> 00:03:17.767
Come on, everyone to your stations!

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.662
Get her dry, before she freezes to death.

00:03:22.792 --> 00:03:23.792
Wait!

00:03:26.917 --> 00:03:27.917
Come on!

00:04:06.083 --> 00:04:07.208
Did you sleep well?

00:04:08.292 --> 00:04:10.587
You have something that belongs to me.

00:04:12.042 --> 00:04:14.625
I had never seen
the Emperor's handwriting.

00:04:15.667 --> 00:04:17.197
Give me that letter back.

00:04:18.583 --> 00:04:19.878
I don't think so, no.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:22.750
What do you want?

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.875
A good reason not to report you.

00:04:28.208 --> 00:04:29.500
Try money.

00:04:30.167 --> 00:04:31.333
It often works.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.583
I don't have any.

00:04:34.375 --> 00:04:35.625
But I have friends.

00:04:37.667 --> 00:04:39.833
If you talk about that letter,

00:04:40.417 --> 00:04:42.958
they will find you and they will kill you,

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.833
Captain Danglars.

00:05:22.708 --> 00:05:23.708
Sir?

00:05:25.375 --> 00:05:27.500
I've caused you a lot of trouble.

00:05:28.375 --> 00:05:30.333
I don't know how to thank you.

00:05:31.667 --> 00:05:32.917
You just did.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.750
Take care of yourself.

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.500
Miss...?

00:05:41.292 --> 00:05:42.292
Angèle.

00:05:43.583 --> 00:05:44.833
Edmond.

00:05:46.042 --> 00:05:48.083
I will never forget your courage.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.792
But forget my name.

00:05:53.375 --> 00:05:54.500
Goodbye, Edmond.

00:05:55.833 --> 00:05:57.250
Goodbye, Angèle.

00:06:08.583 --> 00:06:10.054
Morrel wants to see you.

00:06:16.083 --> 00:06:18.959
We had just changed shifts,
off the coast of Cap Corse.

00:06:19.042 --> 00:06:22.209
The swell was strong.
We were 200 fathoms from the wreck.

00:06:22.292 --> 00:06:23.708
Give me the logbook.

00:06:24.708 --> 00:06:28.917
We were hitting the debris
when Dantès wanted to launch the lifeboat.

00:06:29.083 --> 00:06:31.542
I forbade him. It was madness.

00:06:31.708 --> 00:06:34.000
- Is that true?
- Yes, sir.

00:06:34.167 --> 00:06:36.468
We would have done it for one of our men.

00:06:36.551 --> 00:06:37.625
It was my decision.

00:06:37.708 --> 00:06:39.917
- I took my responsibilities.
- I ordered

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.765
to change course, and he dove.

00:06:42.417 --> 00:06:43.458
You dove?

00:06:43.833 --> 00:06:46.417
He didn't forbid diving.

00:06:46.583 --> 00:06:47.708
That's enough.

00:06:48.375 --> 00:06:50.023
Did you see that insolence?

00:06:51.458 --> 00:06:55.125
Mr. Morrel, I tell you,
this boy is uncontrollable.

00:06:56.125 --> 00:06:58.361
I don't want to sail with him anymore.

00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:04.208
- You will no longer sail with him.
- I warned you.

00:07:04.708 --> 00:07:07.500
Because you will no longer sail for me.

00:07:08.042 --> 00:07:09.042
Pardon?

00:07:10.458 --> 00:07:12.625
How could you let her drown?

00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.708
I... I saved your cargo,
Mr. Morrel.

00:07:15.875 --> 00:07:17.817
Dantès saved my honor, Danglars.

00:07:17.917 --> 00:07:20.153
- Captain.
- You are no longer captain.

00:07:21.375 --> 00:07:24.333
Go prepare your things.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:28.458
- I will arrange your pay.
- We don't know who that woman is.

00:07:28.625 --> 00:07:32.042
I know what you did.
And that's enough for me.

00:07:46.542 --> 00:07:48.417
Kid, come here.

00:07:51.042 --> 00:07:52.292
Come on!

00:07:53.542 --> 00:07:55.208
Let this be a lesson to you.

00:07:55.667 --> 00:07:56.667
Huh?

00:07:57.208 --> 00:08:00.375
When you are a man,
you don't hide behind your rank

00:08:00.542 --> 00:08:01.958
or under a table.

00:08:04.708 --> 00:08:05.792
I present to you

00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.458
my grandson, Maximilien.

00:08:09.208 --> 00:08:10.625
Nice to meet you, Maximilien.

00:08:10.708 --> 00:08:14.542
Maximilien,
I present to you Captain Dantès.

00:08:14.708 --> 00:08:15.875
Good day, Captain.

00:08:16.042 --> 00:08:17.333
So, how old...

00:08:19.125 --> 00:08:20.125
Captain?

00:08:20.542 --> 00:08:23.333
Yes, try to be worthy of it, Edmond.

00:08:25.208 --> 00:08:26.500
Of course, sir.

00:08:27.458 --> 00:08:28.500
Of course.

00:08:29.417 --> 00:08:30.583
Huh?

00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:52.958
That's good.

00:09:00.708 --> 00:09:02.167
Edmond!

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:08.917
I can't believe it.

00:09:09.292 --> 00:09:11.625
I have to...
I have to tell you something.

00:09:11.708 --> 00:09:12.875
That you love me?

00:09:13.417 --> 00:09:15.125
Yes... that. But...

00:09:15.292 --> 00:09:17.750
- No, there's no "but."
- Wait.

00:09:17.917 --> 00:09:19.917
- But I...
- You're starting again.

00:09:26.542 --> 00:09:28.917
You kiss a future captain.

00:09:31.458 --> 00:09:33.164
- You're going to be...
- Yes.

00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958
- So we can...
- Yes. We can.

00:09:51.125 --> 00:09:52.375
I missed you.

00:09:54.125 --> 00:09:56.458
I missed you. I missed you.

00:10:19.583 --> 00:10:20.708
See you later.

00:10:47.167 --> 00:10:48.167
Edmond!

00:10:49.083 --> 00:10:51.542
- Juliette. Are you well?
- And you?

00:10:51.708 --> 00:10:52.708
Yes.

00:10:53.125 --> 00:10:55.708
- How are you?
- It's Edmond, Louis's son.

00:10:55.875 --> 00:10:57.542
- Good day, sir.
- Good day.

00:10:58.333 --> 00:11:01.039
- Where's father? I need to see him.
- At home.

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:02.750
See you later.

00:11:12.917 --> 00:11:13.833
You can smile,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.917
it's good news.

00:11:17.042 --> 00:11:19.000
You look serious.

00:11:19.167 --> 00:11:20.958
It's joy.

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:24.417
I'm so proud of you.

00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:27.958
Captain.

00:11:28.625 --> 00:11:29.625
Captain.

00:11:31.167 --> 00:11:33.520
Did you inform Mr. and Mrs. de Morcerf?

00:11:33.625 --> 00:11:36.458
Not yet.
I wanted to tell you first.

00:11:38.875 --> 00:11:40.875
Everything is going to change, father.

00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.841
We have to announce it to them.

00:11:43.625 --> 00:11:46.750
This is all thanks to them.
And to you, too.

00:11:48.042 --> 00:11:50.583
I didn't pay for your naval studies.

00:11:53.125 --> 00:11:54.417
Come on, go, my son.

00:11:55.417 --> 00:11:57.125
Go pay your respects.

00:12:11.708 --> 00:12:14.208
So, a toast! I raise my glass

00:12:14.375 --> 00:12:16.500
to the memory of your mother, Edmond.

00:12:16.583 --> 00:12:17.917
Because we miss her

00:12:18.875 --> 00:12:20.084
and because she gave birth

00:12:20.167 --> 00:12:22.209
to the youngest captain of Marseille!

00:12:22.292 --> 00:12:25.333
- Bravo!
- Applaud him, he'll be embarrassed.

00:12:28.125 --> 00:12:29.420
There you go, perfect.

00:12:29.625 --> 00:12:31.417
But above all

00:12:31.583 --> 00:12:33.333
because Mathilde Dantès

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:36.792
was the nurse of a future peer of France

00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:39.375
with a heroic destiny,

00:12:39.542 --> 00:12:41.719
one of the finest officers in Europe,

00:12:42.125 --> 00:12:45.542
I name Fernand de Morcerf,
at your service.

00:12:47.667 --> 00:12:50.625
Louis, come toast with us.
This is the occasion.

00:12:51.417 --> 00:12:52.542
Thank you, sir.

00:12:53.083 --> 00:12:54.458
Maybe later.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.292
You can scold Mercédès.
She doesn't listen to me anymore.

00:12:59.375 --> 00:13:02.583
You'll see,
she'll be late for her wedding.

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:04.000
- Ah, finally!
- Ah.

00:13:04.167 --> 00:13:05.250
Excuse my delay,

00:13:05.417 --> 00:13:07.333
aunt. Hello, uncle.

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:08.333
Horace de Balios

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:11.458
was being difficult.
I almost gave him a spanking.

00:13:11.625 --> 00:13:13.083
But really, Mercédès.

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:14.667
Who is this gentleman?

00:13:14.833 --> 00:13:17.209
He's a horse.
He's from a very good family.

00:13:17.292 --> 00:13:19.875
- Hello, my cousin.
- Hello, my cousin.

00:13:22.333 --> 00:13:23.333
Edmond.

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:24.750
Mercédès.

00:13:24.917 --> 00:13:29.292
Are you ready to celebrate?
Edmond has great news.

00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:30.958
Yes, yes.

00:13:33.708 --> 00:13:36.417
Yes, I'm going to be captain.

00:13:36.792 --> 00:13:39.028
Captain of the Pharaon. It's official.

00:13:40.458 --> 00:13:41.635
- Is that true?
- Hm.

00:13:42.417 --> 00:13:44.708
- Bravo.
- To the captain!

00:14:04.417 --> 00:14:07.333
- I got it!
- Ah! To your health!

00:14:08.042 --> 00:14:11.542
- I'm happy for you.
- Me too. I'm happy

00:14:11.708 --> 00:14:14.667
- for me. To yours.
- Are you going to get a new uniform?

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:16.000
He nods.

00:14:16.167 --> 00:14:17.167
And a new pay.

00:14:17.333 --> 00:14:19.042
He'll be able to enjoy life,

00:14:19.208 --> 00:14:20.750
have a good time.

00:14:20.917 --> 00:14:22.329
We'll explain it to him.

00:14:22.542 --> 00:14:25.072
I'm going to be able to marry, especially.

00:14:27.042 --> 00:14:28.042
What?

00:14:28.667 --> 00:14:29.917
You will be my witness.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.792
- Don't count on it!
- Well, yes!

00:14:31.875 --> 00:14:35.125
The witness to a waste!
Mercédès, say something.

00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:40.417
- I tried, but he's madly in love.
- Ah, completely crazy.

00:14:40.583 --> 00:14:44.500
And her, does she know?
Finally, is she in agreement?

00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:46.417
Yes. From what she told me,

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:47.792
- yes, yes.
- I know.

00:14:49.292 --> 00:14:50.292
It's Juliette.

00:14:50.792 --> 00:14:53.375
- Who?
- The maid with the mischievous look.

00:14:53.542 --> 00:14:56.667
No! No, it's not Juliette.

00:14:57.333 --> 00:15:00.417
No, she's a real woman,

00:15:01.083 --> 00:15:02.083
very beautiful.

00:15:02.583 --> 00:15:03.958
Not just beautiful.

00:15:04.625 --> 00:15:05.625
Hm.

00:15:06.042 --> 00:15:09.208
- Mysterious and enchanting.
- Yes! No, no,

00:15:09.375 --> 00:15:11.167
- yes, yes.
- But who is it?

00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:17.375
It's your cousin.

00:15:18.875 --> 00:15:21.375
Mercédès Herrera de Morcerf.

00:15:22.292 --> 00:15:23.292
You?

00:15:23.792 --> 00:15:25.459
- Yes.
- We're getting married.

00:15:25.542 --> 00:15:27.583
But you're completely crazy.

00:15:28.083 --> 00:15:29.667
And your mother will never agree.

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:32.750
You think mom will refuse me anything?

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:37.015
Then you'll convince her.
You've always been her favorite nephew.

00:17:22.541 --> 00:17:23.791
AMEN!

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000
I bring here,

00:17:31.375 --> 00:17:32.667
signed by Mr. de Villefort,

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:34.042
the King's prosecutor,

00:17:34.125 --> 00:17:36.792
an arrest warrant
for the named Edmond Dantès.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:40.792
Follow us.

00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:42.017
What's happening?

00:17:42.167 --> 00:17:44.834
- No, let him be.
- There must be an explanation.

00:17:44.917 --> 00:17:46.625
- Come.
- Let me go.

00:17:47.083 --> 00:17:48.917
- Wait.
- Fernand, do something!

00:17:49.083 --> 00:17:51.542
What's wrong? My
son hasn't done anything.

00:17:51.625 --> 00:17:53.833
It's definitely a misunderstanding.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.125
Where are you taking him?
I'll go with you.

00:17:56.208 --> 00:17:58.750
- We must take him alone, sir.
- Lieutenant.

00:17:58.917 --> 00:18:00.682
Lieutenant Fernand de Morcerf.

00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:03.135
Tell your friends to let us through.

00:18:03.292 --> 00:18:04.792
It's a royal order.

00:18:06.292 --> 00:18:07.417
I'll take care of it.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.333
- Please follow us now.
- Edmond!

00:18:11.458 --> 00:18:13.333
I'll be back, my love.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:53.667
Edmond Dantès, Mr. Prosecutor.

00:18:53.833 --> 00:18:54.958
Let us be.

00:19:03.833 --> 00:19:07.333
I have always admired sailors
like you, Mr. Dantès.

00:19:07.875 --> 00:19:09.625
I only fear the sea.

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:13.458
It's true, this endless abyss.

00:19:15.667 --> 00:19:17.500
These black waters.

00:19:19.167 --> 00:19:23.125
A monster always seems ready to emerge
to devour you.

00:19:25.417 --> 00:19:29.667
What am I being accused of?
Why am I being arrested on my wedding day?

00:19:29.833 --> 00:19:33.083
Do you have an enemy, Mr. Dantès?

00:19:34.792 --> 00:19:36.167
An... an enemy?

00:19:36.958 --> 00:19:38.042
Or a jealous one.

00:19:39.208 --> 00:19:43.458
You've just been named captain,
you're going to marry a fine match...

00:19:44.292 --> 00:19:46.792
You may have made some envious.

00:19:47.167 --> 00:19:49.417
I don't know, no.

00:19:49.583 --> 00:19:52.625
I had a disagreement recently
with a crew member,

00:19:52.792 --> 00:19:54.616
but what could he accuse me of?

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.167
I don't know.

00:19:59.833 --> 00:20:02.250
Of being a Bonapartist agent, for example.

00:20:02.333 --> 00:20:03.333
Excuse me?

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.417
But... that makes no sense.

00:20:11.958 --> 00:20:15.125
We found this Bible in your cabin.

00:20:16.333 --> 00:20:18.000
Is this your Bible?

00:20:18.542 --> 00:20:20.542
Your name is written in it.

00:20:21.833 --> 00:20:24.875
Yes, but that's not a crime.

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:26.458
That's true.

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:31.833
But we also found
inside an order of mission

00:20:32.458 --> 00:20:35.083
signed by Napoleon himself.

00:20:35.708 --> 00:20:37.417
And that is a crime.

00:20:37.958 --> 00:20:38.958
Wait.

00:20:39.792 --> 00:20:42.750
No, this is the first time
I've seen this letter.

00:20:43.708 --> 00:20:47.061
If you have no enemy,
who could have slipped it in there?

00:20:49.375 --> 00:20:53.140
Off the coast of Cap Corse,
I saved a young woman from drowning.

00:20:53.625 --> 00:20:55.833
Did she thank you in your cabin?

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:56.833
No.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
Danglars locked her up there.
She left in Marseille.

00:21:00.875 --> 00:21:02.458
You can check.

00:21:02.833 --> 00:21:06.667
Ask Quartermaster Gaspard Caderousse.

00:21:07.167 --> 00:21:09.083
- Caderousse?
- Yes.

00:21:09.917 --> 00:21:11.459
What do you know about her?

00:21:11.542 --> 00:21:12.542
Nothing.

00:21:13.083 --> 00:21:14.250
Mr. Dantès.

00:21:14.958 --> 00:21:17.292
I've interrogated dozens of conspirators

00:21:17.375 --> 00:21:19.552
and I believe you're not one of them.

00:21:20.083 --> 00:21:22.833
I'm willing to help a
friend of the Morcerfs,

00:21:23.417 --> 00:21:25.292
but I need you to help me.

00:21:25.667 --> 00:21:28.079
I swear to you I know nothing about her.

00:21:31.875 --> 00:21:33.758
She told me her name was Angèle.

00:21:34.542 --> 00:21:35.667
That's all.

00:21:43.625 --> 00:21:44.625
Did you...

00:21:44.875 --> 00:21:47.708
reveal the name of this young woman
to anyone?

00:21:48.125 --> 00:21:49.125
No.

00:21:51.792 --> 00:21:53.583
Not even to that Caderousse?

00:21:54.125 --> 00:21:55.125
No.

00:21:55.583 --> 00:21:57.625
To no one. I swear.

00:21:58.708 --> 00:22:02.167
Well, you see, Mr. Dantès,
I believe you.

00:22:03.917 --> 00:22:07.250
However, I'm going to have to
keep you a bit longer,

00:22:07.417 --> 00:22:09.959
until I can interrogate
the rest of the crew.

00:22:10.042 --> 00:22:13.042
If they confirm your testimony,
which I have no doubt they will,

00:22:13.125 --> 00:22:17.375
I will return you to your fiancée,
who will have plenty of time to hate me.

00:22:17.458 --> 00:22:19.583
Count on her.

00:22:23.292 --> 00:22:24.998
Fernand will bring you back.

00:22:28.708 --> 00:22:30.792
I can't take it anymore, I'm going.

00:22:30.875 --> 00:22:32.750
You can't do anything more.

00:22:34.042 --> 00:22:36.690
It would suit you
if they didn't release him.

00:22:38.417 --> 00:22:41.208
How can you say such horrors?

00:22:59.792 --> 00:23:03.500
Gerard, whatever you've been
told about Dantès, I stand by him.

00:23:06.583 --> 00:23:08.995
Let us be alone for a moment, gentlemen.

00:23:19.458 --> 00:23:21.667
Fernand, I'm sorry for your friend.

00:23:22.458 --> 00:23:23.750
I know your ties.

00:23:25.083 --> 00:23:26.848
But you don't know everything.

00:23:28.625 --> 00:23:32.000
We found an order of mission
from the Emperor on him.

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:35.927
And his crew members claim
he is one of his supporters.

00:23:37.417 --> 00:23:40.888
I think you understand
the seriousness of these accusations.

00:23:42.583 --> 00:23:44.459
He was arrested
before he could marry Mercédès

00:23:44.542 --> 00:23:46.954
and before the irreparable was committed,

00:23:47.458 --> 00:23:49.833
but if you are willing to vouch for him,

00:23:50.542 --> 00:23:53.125
if you think these two men are lying...

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.059
If you are ready to take that risk,

00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:58.875
then I will free him.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.765
You only need to say one word.

00:24:10.375 --> 00:24:11.375
No.

00:24:15.708 --> 00:24:16.708
No?

00:24:22.125 --> 00:24:23.583
He does not deserve...

00:24:27.542 --> 00:24:29.083
He does not deserve what?

00:24:33.167 --> 00:24:35.458
For our family name to be sullied.

00:24:45.333 --> 00:24:47.208
If Dantès has betrayed us,

00:24:48.833 --> 00:24:51.069
he should suffer the fate of traitors.

00:24:51.667 --> 00:24:53.375
I can ensure...

00:24:54.292 --> 00:24:57.667
that no trial will tarnish the
reputation of the Morcerfs.

00:25:00.875 --> 00:25:03.042
I will need your testimony.

00:25:16.458 --> 00:25:18.635
Do you understand what is happening?

00:25:20.875 --> 00:25:22.458
Then keep your mouth shut.

00:25:31.875 --> 00:25:35.750
- Mr. Dantès?
- Did you get to speak to the prosecutor?

00:25:35.917 --> 00:25:37.542
Yes, sir.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.125
This is a day I will never forget.

00:25:45.625 --> 00:25:47.250
Aren't you taking me home?

00:25:47.792 --> 00:25:49.042
No, indeed.

00:25:49.625 --> 00:25:50.625
Go.

00:25:52.333 --> 00:25:55.083
What's happening? What's happening?

00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:56.083
Let me go.

00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:58.959
Call the prosecutor.
I spoke with the prosecutor!

00:25:59.042 --> 00:26:01.125
Call him. Call him!

00:26:01.292 --> 00:26:04.833
I'm innocent! I did nothing!
Let me go.

00:26:16.083 --> 00:26:18.375
Shh, shh, shh.

00:26:20.708 --> 00:26:23.375
If you were guilty, they would have
hanged you. They're taking you away,

00:26:23.458 --> 00:26:26.517
because you know things
that they don't want to hear.

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:30.750
Come on.

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:44.750
Stop.

00:26:45.583 --> 00:26:46.917
Stop!

00:26:55.208 --> 00:26:56.542
Let me go!

00:27:11.625 --> 00:27:12.833
Where is he?

00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:14.750
I couldn't do anything.

00:27:17.583 --> 00:27:18.583
Mercédès.

00:27:19.375 --> 00:27:20.375
Let me be.

00:27:21.708 --> 00:27:23.333
It wouldn't help.

00:27:24.333 --> 00:27:25.833
- Mercédès...
- Stop.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.125
Please.

00:27:55.542 --> 00:27:57.375
What's going on, Victoria?

00:27:58.542 --> 00:28:01.833
- Aren't you happy to see me?
- Your sister is here.

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:15.542
Mademoiselle de Villefort.

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:18.625
You wear your secrets well.

00:28:19.708 --> 00:28:22.375
Sorry I can't return the compliment.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.583
Cognac?
Sorry, I'm all out of seawater.

00:28:29.208 --> 00:28:32.125
Yes, it's my job to know everything.

00:28:33.583 --> 00:28:35.760
So you know that Dantès is innocent.

00:28:35.917 --> 00:28:37.625
Innocent... Yeah.

00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:40.780
But who is truly innocent?

00:28:41.042 --> 00:28:44.042
He did nothing.
Why did you arrest him?

00:28:44.625 --> 00:28:46.667
In order to save your life.

00:28:46.833 --> 00:28:48.481
My life or your reputation?

00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:52.458
We're both playing politics.

00:28:53.125 --> 00:28:55.417
In politics, you don't eliminate a man,

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:57.083
you eliminate an obstacle.

00:28:57.250 --> 00:29:00.208
I knew you practiced your profession
with cruelty,

00:29:00.375 --> 00:29:02.964
but I had hoped
you at least did it honestly.

00:29:03.125 --> 00:29:06.292
Why don't you confess in his place?

00:29:07.125 --> 00:29:08.917
But I will, Gérard.

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:11.853
If you refuse to save him, I will do it.

00:29:12.292 --> 00:29:15.175
But you would prefer
that my existence be ignored,

00:29:15.375 --> 00:29:17.000
as well as that of Victoria,

00:29:17.083 --> 00:29:18.292
your mistress,

00:29:18.542 --> 00:29:20.208
and your future child.

00:29:30.458 --> 00:29:31.833
Just as I thought.

00:29:50.958 --> 00:29:54.870
CHATEAU D'IF PRISON
FOUR YEARS LATER

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.083
Alive?

00:30:06.583 --> 00:30:07.750
Alive.

00:30:20.333 --> 00:30:22.667
Alive?

00:30:23.708 --> 00:30:24.708
Alive!

00:30:33.292 --> 00:30:34.292
Alive?

00:30:35.625 --> 00:30:36.625
Alive.

00:31:58.958 --> 00:32:01.875
Take wide...
Stay clear of the coast...

00:32:02.042 --> 00:32:05.208
And who knows the way...
Who knows exactly...

00:33:00.333 --> 00:33:03.250
Is anyone there? Is anyone there?

00:33:10.583 --> 00:33:13.250
Is anyone there? Is anyone there?

00:33:16.125 --> 00:33:17.125
Is anyone there?

00:33:18.417 --> 00:33:20.625
Is anyone there? Is anyone there?

00:33:24.208 --> 00:33:25.333
Is anyone there?

00:33:37.667 --> 00:33:38.667
Who are you?

00:33:39.417 --> 00:33:42.250
Uh, I... Dantès, Edmond Dantès.

00:33:43.292 --> 00:33:44.750
How old are you?

00:33:45.917 --> 00:33:48.708
- Your voice sounds like a young man's.
- I'm...

00:33:51.917 --> 00:33:53.500
I don't know anymore.

00:33:53.667 --> 00:33:57.208
I was 22...
when they imprisoned me.

00:33:58.208 --> 00:34:00.542
On May 16, 1815.

00:34:01.792 --> 00:34:03.542
That was four years ago.

00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:07.958
You are 26 years old.

00:34:09.833 --> 00:34:11.625
Four years?

00:34:14.542 --> 00:34:15.542
And...

00:34:16.917 --> 00:34:19.250
And you, who are you?

00:34:21.292 --> 00:34:22.542
A prisoner.

00:34:24.375 --> 00:34:25.375
Like you.

00:34:26.167 --> 00:34:27.625
For how long?

00:34:28.833 --> 00:34:29.708
Shh!

00:34:29.875 --> 00:34:30.792
What?

00:34:30.958 --> 00:34:32.375
- They're coming.
- Wait.

00:34:32.542 --> 00:34:33.542
Don't leave me.

00:34:34.083 --> 00:34:36.750
Who are you?
At least tell me your name.

00:34:37.708 --> 00:34:39.125
Your name!

00:34:45.125 --> 00:34:47.083
34! Alive?

00:34:49.333 --> 00:34:50.333
Alive.

00:37:05.667 --> 00:37:07.208
I was waiting for you.

00:37:15.042 --> 00:37:17.708
Do you really think
you can get out of here?

00:37:17.875 --> 00:37:19.817
I've dug 30 meters in six years.

00:37:20.375 --> 00:37:23.042
To go around your cell
and reach the outside,

00:37:24.042 --> 00:37:26.375
it will take twice as long.

00:37:27.375 --> 00:37:28.375
12 years?

00:37:28.625 --> 00:37:32.417
Maybe a little less,
now that we'll be two.

00:37:34.042 --> 00:37:36.875
Why? Do you have other plans?

00:37:40.417 --> 00:37:41.417
No.

00:37:42.625 --> 00:37:46.083
I am Abbot Faria.

00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:51.083
Edmond Dantès.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.167
Had you ever seen this letter?

00:38:19.333 --> 00:38:21.208
No, never.

00:38:25.833 --> 00:38:29.292
And you?
Do you know why you are here?

00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:33.375
Yes.

00:38:36.917 --> 00:38:40.153
They wanted to silence you.
They wanted to make me talk.

00:38:43.083 --> 00:38:46.458
He speaks in Italian.

00:38:49.167 --> 00:38:51.708
I choose the people I confide in.

00:38:52.292 --> 00:38:53.917
You don't know Italian?

00:38:56.083 --> 00:39:00.333
- No.
- English, Arabic, Latin, Greek?

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:03.417
I only know the sea.

00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:07.458
If you want, I'll teach you.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.750
With patience and will, in...

00:39:13.708 --> 00:39:16.532
in 6 or 7 years,
you will know everything I know.

00:39:18.708 --> 00:39:20.958
History, philosophy,

00:39:21.417 --> 00:39:22.708
mathematics.

00:39:23.125 --> 00:39:24.583
These are...

00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:26.292
These are weapons

00:39:27.417 --> 00:39:30.083
that free just as much as this one.

00:39:32.417 --> 00:39:33.417
Hm.

00:40:35.125 --> 00:40:37.375
What is the first thing you will do

00:40:37.917 --> 00:40:39.333
if we manage to get out?

00:40:42.542 --> 00:40:44.333
I will find Mercédès.

00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:49.456
What will you do
if she hasn't waited for you?

00:40:52.333 --> 00:40:54.208
Then I will have nothing left.

00:40:54.958 --> 00:40:57.500
I will tell you a story, Edmond.

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:02.042
Seven hundred years ago,

00:41:02.458 --> 00:41:05.042
in Jerusalem, during the First Crusade,

00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:07.750
the knights

00:41:07.917 --> 00:41:12.329
charged with protecting the tomb of Christ
create the Order of the Templars.

00:41:12.708 --> 00:41:13.750
On the first day,

00:41:13.917 --> 00:41:17.542
they are just a few,
but they have immense faith.

00:41:19.417 --> 00:41:21.458
Thanks to their victories,

00:41:22.167 --> 00:41:24.667
the order amasses a fortune...

00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:28.000
considerable.

00:41:28.167 --> 00:41:31.333
Consi... Considerable.

00:41:33.417 --> 00:41:37.182
I'm talking about the greatest treasure
the Earth has ever known.

00:41:38.417 --> 00:41:39.417
And...

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.375
over time,

00:41:43.625 --> 00:41:46.214
their power, their wealth,
makes them envied.

00:41:47.417 --> 00:41:51.875
And on Friday, October 13, 1307,
the King of France, Philip the Fair,

00:41:52.042 --> 00:41:54.000
orders their arrest

00:41:54.167 --> 00:41:55.991
and the seizure of their goods.

00:41:57.833 --> 00:42:00.375
But no one ever found the treasure.

00:42:04.583 --> 00:42:05.708
Do you know...

00:42:07.708 --> 00:42:11.292
what these knights did
with this immense fortune?

00:42:12.583 --> 00:42:14.458
- No.
- Nothing!

00:42:16.042 --> 00:42:18.208
Edmond, nothing.

00:42:18.958 --> 00:42:20.750
Too busy seeking revenge,

00:42:22.208 --> 00:42:25.375
punishing those who had betrayed them,

00:42:25.917 --> 00:42:28.042
they died one after the other.

00:42:30.708 --> 00:42:32.414
At least, almost all of them.

00:42:35.083 --> 00:42:36.292
The last of them

00:42:36.958 --> 00:42:38.708
was Cardinal Spada.

00:42:40.333 --> 00:42:45.083
At the end of his life,
sheltered on the island of Monte-Cristo,

00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:49.542
he had time to train one last knight.

00:42:51.375 --> 00:42:53.292
This young man was called...

00:42:53.917 --> 00:42:55.583
Giuseppe Faria.

00:42:59.542 --> 00:43:02.500
I am the last survivor, Edmond.

00:43:03.458 --> 00:43:05.208
And I know

00:43:05.375 --> 00:43:07.250
where the treasure is.

00:43:09.958 --> 00:43:10.958
Half of which

00:43:11.042 --> 00:43:13.250
belongs to you today.

00:43:14.708 --> 00:43:17.083
But what will you do with this fortune?

00:43:20.833 --> 00:43:22.375
Will you do good

00:43:24.083 --> 00:43:26.792
or will you let your heart
fill with hatred?

00:43:35.916 --> 00:43:40.500
10 YEARS LATER

00:44:18.125 --> 00:44:19.773
I'm going to empty the bag.

00:44:23.083 --> 00:44:24.083
Edmond.

00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:26.250
Huh?

00:44:29.208 --> 00:44:30.250
It's salty.

00:44:31.208 --> 00:44:33.167
The water, it's salty.

00:44:34.833 --> 00:44:38.042
We're almost there.
It's a matter of days.

00:44:44.917 --> 00:44:46.792
We're there, we're there.

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:49.618
I'll be right back.

00:44:54.833 --> 00:44:55.833
Step back!

00:45:05.208 --> 00:45:06.208
Abbot?!

00:45:11.042 --> 00:45:13.250
Abbot! Abbot!

00:45:33.667 --> 00:45:34.583
Here.

00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:37.250
- Edmond.
- No, no, don't talk.

00:45:37.417 --> 00:45:39.333
I'm going to call for help.

00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:40.500
No.

00:45:40.917 --> 00:45:42.750
(In Italian)
It's too late.

00:45:44.833 --> 00:45:46.833
Don't be sad.

00:45:49.958 --> 00:45:53.792
You have been the only comfort of my life.

00:45:54.208 --> 00:45:56.667
The Lord gave it to me...

00:45:57.625 --> 00:45:59.750
a little late, but he gave it to me.

00:46:04.208 --> 00:46:06.583
I am not mad, Edmond.

00:46:07.542 --> 00:46:08.667
I know.

00:46:10.375 --> 00:46:12.167
The treasure exists.

00:46:13.792 --> 00:46:15.375
You know where to find it.

00:46:16.333 --> 00:46:18.667
We will go look for it together!

00:46:18.833 --> 00:46:20.083
Don't forget.

00:46:20.542 --> 00:46:22.625
Monte-Cristo.

00:46:23.542 --> 00:46:25.542
Monte-Cristo.

00:46:27.667 --> 00:46:28.958
Mount...

00:46:35.958 --> 00:46:37.208
Don't leave me.

00:46:38.125 --> 00:46:40.042
Don't leave me. Huh?

00:46:41.333 --> 00:46:42.583
Don't leave me.

00:47:02.625 --> 00:47:04.417
Alive?

00:47:04.792 --> 00:47:05.792
Alive!

00:47:11.292 --> 00:47:13.167
Alive?

00:47:15.292 --> 00:47:16.375
Number 17?

00:47:18.625 --> 00:47:19.750
Oh, 17!

00:48:11.167 --> 00:48:12.208
Oh, abbot?

00:48:23.917 --> 00:48:26.750
Oh! He is dead, throw the sack!

00:49:26.125 --> 00:49:27.125
Which one is it?

00:49:27.708 --> 00:49:28.708
It is the abbot.

00:49:41.875 --> 00:49:42.875
Alive?

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.000
Alive!

00:50:04.583 --> 00:50:06.792
Alive?

00:50:14.292 --> 00:50:16.542
Alive?

00:50:44.125 --> 00:50:45.125
Stand up.

00:50:46.167 --> 00:50:47.167
Stand up!

00:50:49.250 --> 00:50:50.333
I said stand up!

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.000
Alert!

00:51:00.875 --> 00:51:01.625
ONE...

00:51:01.792 --> 00:51:03.583
Alert!

00:51:04.208 --> 00:51:05.208
TWO...

00:51:05.875 --> 00:51:06.875
Alert!

00:51:07.333 --> 00:51:08.375
AND THREE!

00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:32.708
Hey! You shouldn't be here.

00:54:32.875 --> 00:54:33.875
Go away!

00:54:34.542 --> 00:54:37.417
I came to see Louis. Louis Dantès.

00:54:37.833 --> 00:54:39.333
Did you know Louis?

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.000
Yes.

00:54:41.708 --> 00:54:43.708
We buried that poor Louis.

00:54:44.708 --> 00:54:46.333
A long time ago.

00:54:50.458 --> 00:54:52.083
No, that can't be true.

00:54:52.250 --> 00:54:55.250
He let himself die of hunger
after his son's death.

00:54:56.458 --> 00:54:58.000
He wanted to join him.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:04.292
But his...

00:55:04.458 --> 00:55:06.333
But his son is not dead.

00:55:08.083 --> 00:55:09.333
I'm sorry.

00:55:15.958 --> 00:55:17.750
You were a sailor too?

00:55:18.667 --> 00:55:20.417
- Yes.
- Hm.

00:55:20.875 --> 00:55:24.523
I will give you something to eat.
But then you disappear, okay?

00:55:30.292 --> 00:55:33.000
And Mercé... Mercédès?

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:35.583
And Fernand de Morcerf?

00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:38.542
They haven't come by in 7 or 8 years.

00:55:38.958 --> 00:55:42.429
They have been living in Paris
since the birth of their son.

00:55:44.708 --> 00:55:46.083
You are too late.

00:56:44.208 --> 00:56:46.917
Avoid the Ligurian Sea

00:56:47.083 --> 00:56:49.000
and its endless patrols.

00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:51.458
Set course for Sardinia.

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:56.583
You can stop at Santa Teresa di Gallura.

00:56:57.458 --> 00:56:59.833
The island of Monte-Cristo is

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.417
to the west of the Tuscan Archipelago.

00:57:22.792 --> 00:57:25.458
You will dock at the southern tip.

00:57:25.625 --> 00:57:30.333
I know you will be overwhelmed
by its austere beauty.

00:57:31.875 --> 00:57:35.750
I envy you for discovering it
for the first time.

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:38.208
There.

00:57:38.667 --> 00:57:39.833
That's it.

00:57:41.292 --> 00:57:44.292
The tomb of the illustrious Spada family.

00:57:44.667 --> 00:57:46.167
The rest, Edmond,

00:57:47.458 --> 00:57:48.708
is your story.

00:57:51.458 --> 00:57:54.542
The story of a man who holds the world

00:57:55.292 --> 00:57:57.167
in the palm of his hand.

01:00:21.208 --> 01:00:25.000
MARSEILLE
ONE YEAR LATER

01:00:41.292 --> 01:00:43.083
- I beg you, go ahead.
- Stop.

01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:46.250
- I'll pay you tomorrow.
- No, no. Gaspard, get out.

01:00:46.333 --> 01:00:48.667
M. Caderousse is my friend.

01:00:59.167 --> 01:01:03.458
On his deathbed, Edmond Dantès
asked me to share with those

01:01:03.625 --> 01:01:06.125
who mattered to him.

01:01:08.958 --> 01:01:12.625
He thought he had been betrayed
by a certain Danglars.

01:01:13.875 --> 01:01:18.167
But he was convinced that two men
had remained loyal to him.

01:01:18.583 --> 01:01:19.583
He told me:

01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:22.375
"One is named Gaspard Caderousse,

01:01:22.917 --> 01:01:26.292
"and the second, Fernand de Morcerf."

01:01:28.292 --> 01:01:29.542
Keep your diamond.

01:01:29.708 --> 01:01:31.917
None of us deserves anything.

01:01:32.667 --> 01:01:34.125
Wait, my son.

01:01:34.708 --> 01:01:38.042
If I reveal what I know,
they will know it came from me.

01:01:38.208 --> 01:01:40.542
And these people are rich and powerful.

01:01:40.958 --> 01:01:42.792
You have nothing to fear,

01:01:42.958 --> 01:01:46.042
I am bound by the secret of confession.

01:01:46.333 --> 01:01:47.583
Have a seat.

01:01:56.375 --> 01:02:00.140
Dantès was right about Danglars.
He is the one who betrayed him.

01:02:02.583 --> 01:02:06.542
But Fernand de Morcerf?
He was his friend.

01:02:08.375 --> 01:02:11.552
Can one be a friend
to someone whose woman one covets?

01:02:12.417 --> 01:02:14.250
Out of love for Mercédès,

01:02:14.792 --> 01:02:16.417
he sacrificed Edmond.

01:02:22.833 --> 01:02:25.958
He will live.
But to everyone, he will be dead.

01:02:29.042 --> 01:02:30.042
Hm.

01:02:30.167 --> 01:02:33.991
The only one who would have deserved
Dantès' affection is Morrel.

01:02:34.833 --> 01:02:36.375
The shipowner?

01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:39.417
He fought to free him.

01:02:40.333 --> 01:02:43.292
And he too,
providence has rewarded him little.

01:02:44.167 --> 01:02:46.083
After Dantès' arrest,

01:02:46.250 --> 01:02:48.833
he had to take Danglars back as captain.

01:02:49.208 --> 01:02:51.250
But Danglars betrayed him too.

01:02:51.833 --> 01:02:54.208
He made half of his fleet disappear,

01:02:54.375 --> 01:02:57.458
allegedly stolen by pirates.

01:02:57.625 --> 01:03:00.875
Ruined, Morrel had to sell the company.

01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:04.375
And guess who bought it for a pittance?

01:03:04.542 --> 01:03:05.833
Danglars.

01:03:06.708 --> 01:03:10.042
Two months later, the ships reappeared.

01:03:10.875 --> 01:03:13.375
But the prosecutor Villefort didn't budge.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.500
To be fair, they shared a secret.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.708
Little Victoria, Villefort's mistress,

01:03:20.875 --> 01:03:22.581
she had become Mrs. Danglars.

01:03:24.833 --> 01:03:26.500
She is a baroness today

01:03:27.417 --> 01:03:30.042
Morrel, on the other
hand, died in poverty.

01:03:33.458 --> 01:03:36.458
And you, in all this, Mr. Caderousse?

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.292
You?

01:03:39.542 --> 01:03:41.250
What could I do

01:03:41.958 --> 01:03:44.875
against a captain,
a count, and a prosecutor?

01:03:47.333 --> 01:03:51.583
If I had been braver,
I would surely have ended up like her.

01:03:52.542 --> 01:03:53.542
Her?

01:03:54.625 --> 01:03:55.625
Angèle.

01:03:59.458 --> 01:04:02.208
She had gone to see her brother
to save Dantès.

01:04:02.375 --> 01:04:03.709
I got rid of Dantès for you.

01:04:03.792 --> 01:04:05.969
Now it's your turn to get rid of her.

01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:10.167
You see? I have friends too.

01:04:14.375 --> 01:04:15.500
What happened?

01:04:17.208 --> 01:04:18.708
Did she get killed?

01:04:19.958 --> 01:04:21.723
She would have suffered less.

01:04:22.458 --> 01:04:24.625
Danglars had other plans for her.

01:04:25.042 --> 01:04:29.209
He sold her to the Maillard brothers,
the masters of a brothel in Toulon.

01:04:29.292 --> 01:04:30.833
The girl was pretty,

01:04:31.125 --> 01:04:32.773
he got a good price for her.

01:04:34.458 --> 01:04:36.792
You knew everything and did nothing.

01:04:38.542 --> 01:04:40.083
I am ashamed, Father.

01:04:42.417 --> 01:04:44.167
One day, I will return.

01:04:44.333 --> 01:04:47.275
And I will offer you the chance
to redeem yourself.

01:05:04.333 --> 01:05:07.042
I no longer come to plead or seek you out,

01:05:07.750 --> 01:05:09.667
but only to warn you:

01:05:10.583 --> 01:05:12.878
I am going to do what you could not do.

01:05:13.875 --> 01:05:17.542
From now on,
I am the one who rewards and punishes.

01:05:46.667 --> 01:05:48.458
Do you want something?

01:06:24.125 --> 01:06:25.417
Who are you?

01:06:44.125 --> 01:06:45.583
Years ago,

01:06:46.125 --> 01:06:47.250
you told me:

01:06:48.792 --> 01:06:51.875
"I will not forget your courage,
but forget my name."

01:06:54.292 --> 01:06:58.000
Well, I have forgotten neither your name
nor your courage.

01:07:02.250 --> 01:07:04.125
Dantès.

01:07:09.708 --> 01:07:12.125
I came to find you, Angèle.

01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:17.208
For me, it's too late.

01:07:20.250 --> 01:07:22.167
But you can save the child.

01:07:24.292 --> 01:07:25.292
The child?

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.917
When I arrived here,

01:07:40.458 --> 01:07:42.500
I had only one idea in mind:

01:07:44.583 --> 01:07:46.348
to take revenge on my brother.

01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:51.708
For weeks, I looked for a way to escape.

01:07:54.417 --> 01:07:57.542
One day, the opportunity presented itself.
I fled.

01:07:59.583 --> 01:08:01.000
With a client.

01:08:03.333 --> 01:08:04.667
A draper from Paris.

01:08:07.083 --> 01:08:09.500
I knew Gérard had been appointed there.

01:08:11.458 --> 01:08:13.750
I tracked down Victoria,

01:08:14.875 --> 01:08:16.250
his mistress.

01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:20.667
I wanted to pick up the story
where it had left off.

01:08:24.250 --> 01:08:26.042
It was freezing cold.

01:08:30.625 --> 01:08:32.792
That night...

01:08:32.957 --> 01:08:34.417
Gérard had to die.

01:08:36.250 --> 01:08:38.042
Nothing could stop me.

01:08:39.792 --> 01:08:42.832
I can still feel the metal of the knife
in my hand.

01:08:45.082 --> 01:08:47.000
But nothing went as planned.

01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:56.292
I heard a scream.

01:08:56.542 --> 01:08:58.292
The scream of Victoria.

01:08:58.957 --> 01:09:03.167
When Gérard came out into the garden,
he was carrying a chest.

01:09:03.750 --> 01:09:05.167
I followed him.

01:09:16.082 --> 01:09:18.707
I got closer when...

01:09:18.875 --> 01:09:21.832
I heard the muffled cries of a child.

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:33.375
I couldn't leave him.

01:09:34.957 --> 01:09:37.487
He still had his mother's blood
on his body.

01:09:44.750 --> 01:09:46.792
Between vengeance and life...

01:09:48.917 --> 01:09:50.542
I chose life.

01:09:56.250 --> 01:09:58.042
I fled with him.

01:09:59.958 --> 01:10:02.167
I didn't know anyone in Paris.

01:10:04.375 --> 01:10:06.792
So I returned to my draper.

01:10:09.083 --> 01:10:11.833
But the Maillard brothers had found him.

01:10:13.125 --> 01:10:14.831
And they were waiting for me.

01:10:22.833 --> 01:10:23.917
Angèle...

01:10:27.458 --> 01:10:29.047
What happened to the child?

01:11:01.750 --> 01:11:03.083
Hello, André.

01:11:04.083 --> 01:11:05.833
Angèle sent me to fetch you.

01:11:06.542 --> 01:11:07.542
Why?

01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:11.125
She is going to die.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:15.292
I will take you to her
so you can say goodbye.

01:11:17.625 --> 01:11:18.861
After, we will leave.

01:11:20.792 --> 01:11:21.833
We will take...

01:11:22.750 --> 01:11:24.792
all the time we need to be ready.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.208
Ready for what?

01:11:28.542 --> 01:11:30.833
To take revenge, André.

01:11:33.208 --> 01:11:36.000
To take revenge on the three men
who stole her life,

01:11:36.083 --> 01:11:37.208
yours

01:11:37.667 --> 01:11:38.792
and mine.

01:11:40.542 --> 01:11:43.667
- I want to kill them.
- That would be too easy.

01:11:44.167 --> 01:11:45.333
Too sweet.

01:11:47.417 --> 01:11:48.417
No.

01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:52.208
We must rip out their hearts.

01:11:54.750 --> 01:11:55.958
Who are you?

01:11:57.792 --> 01:12:00.167
I am the Count of Monte Cristo.

01:12:08.250 --> 01:12:11.917
General de Morcerf
has decided today to leave the army

01:12:12.083 --> 01:12:15.319
to dedicate his life to politics,
to the House of Lords.

01:12:15.417 --> 01:12:17.917
The French army loses a great soldier,

01:12:18.083 --> 01:12:20.958
but France gains a great man.

01:12:21.875 --> 01:12:23.208
Fernand de Morcerf

01:12:23.375 --> 01:12:25.750
fought at Moskova, at Leipzig,

01:12:25.917 --> 01:12:26.917
in Turkey...

01:12:27.083 --> 01:12:29.375
Everywhere, at the risk of his life,
he defended

01:12:29.458 --> 01:12:31.811
a certain idea of the kingdom of France.

01:12:33.375 --> 01:12:38.125
Fernand paid in flesh the price
of his commitment and the respect

01:12:38.292 --> 01:12:39.625
of the word given.

01:12:39.792 --> 01:12:43.125
Ten years ago, when France's ally

01:12:43.292 --> 01:12:46.917
Ali Pasha of Janina
was besieged by Turkish troops,

01:12:47.083 --> 01:12:50.625
Colonel de Morcerf went all in.

01:12:51.167 --> 01:12:54.083
At the head of a squadron
of valiant soldiers,

01:12:54.250 --> 01:12:57.125
he broke through the
back line of the Ottomans

01:12:57.292 --> 01:12:59.708
And come to his ally's aid.

01:13:00.042 --> 01:13:03.125
This act of insane courage

01:13:03.292 --> 01:13:07.208
unfortunately wasn't enough,
but all the French know:

01:13:07.375 --> 01:13:10.000
"You do not fight in hopes of success!

01:13:10.167 --> 01:13:14.125
"No! No, it is even more beautiful
when it is useless."

01:14:00.792 --> 01:14:02.042
Is it better?

01:14:07.125 --> 01:14:10.302
You haven't been very attentive
with Eugénie Danglars.

01:14:10.708 --> 01:14:12.584
- Father.
- She will have 2 million as a dowry,

01:14:12.667 --> 01:14:14.167
the day of her wedding.

01:14:14.333 --> 01:14:15.375
Fernand!

01:14:15.542 --> 01:14:17.895
So I must pay attention to her fortune.

01:14:18.875 --> 01:14:21.708
Better to have one less medal
and one more zero.

01:14:24.667 --> 01:14:28.792
Our son is a man of his time.
He is a romantic who believes in...

01:15:02.208 --> 01:15:03.500
Give the medal back!

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:55.000
There!

01:16:16.083 --> 01:16:17.250
That's enough.

01:17:42.125 --> 01:17:46.125
If I had known the honor of your visit,
I would have prepared for it.

01:17:47.875 --> 01:17:51.875
If I had known the honor of your visit,
I would have prepared for it.

01:19:17.583 --> 01:19:18.750
Get out!

01:19:21.333 --> 01:19:25.000
Gentlemen...
If I had known the honor of your visit,

01:19:25.167 --> 01:19:26.083
I would have prepared for it.

01:19:26.250 --> 01:19:30.292
I apologize for welcoming you
into an improvised home.

01:19:30.458 --> 01:19:33.000
I have only been in
France for a short time.

01:19:33.083 --> 01:19:35.167
Count, I am sorry to intrude,

01:19:35.333 --> 01:19:37.875
but we can never thank you enough.

01:19:39.083 --> 01:19:42.500
I am certain
he would have done the same for me.

01:19:42.875 --> 01:19:44.958
Count, I owe you my life.

01:19:46.667 --> 01:19:49.500
I am glad to see you on your two feet.

01:19:52.042 --> 01:19:54.513
I had it repaired, the stock was cracked.

01:19:55.583 --> 01:19:57.208
It is yours now.

01:19:58.833 --> 01:20:02.292
I thank you immensely,
but I cannot accept.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:06.750
I already have a debt to you
that I do not know how to repay.

01:20:12.292 --> 01:20:13.667
Do you like weapons?

01:20:17.208 --> 01:20:18.333
Please.

01:20:33.792 --> 01:20:35.675
This is one of my finest pieces.

01:20:36.208 --> 01:20:37.917
Ottoman-style pistol.

01:20:39.125 --> 01:20:42.083
Yes, but the iron guard
with engraved foliage

01:20:42.250 --> 01:20:46.083
indicates that this barrel
is rather European-made.

01:20:46.792 --> 01:20:48.792
From Venice, indeed.

01:20:49.250 --> 01:20:50.833
You are a connoisseur.

01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:53.853
My father fought against Sultan Khursit

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.177
alongside Ali Pasha.

01:20:55.292 --> 01:20:56.708
Morcerf.

01:20:57.625 --> 01:20:59.709
You are the famous General de Morcerf?

01:20:59.792 --> 01:21:01.125
I am very impressed.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.458
Would you try it?

01:21:03.833 --> 01:21:06.667
Unfortunately,
I am expected at the Chamber.

01:21:06.833 --> 01:21:09.292
- Another time.
- It won't take a moment.

01:21:37.917 --> 01:21:39.583
You deserve your reputation,

01:21:39.750 --> 01:21:40.750
General.

01:21:41.875 --> 01:21:44.228
Let's change the target for you, Albert.

01:21:53.917 --> 01:21:55.625
Remind me to never

01:21:55.792 --> 01:21:57.417
challenge you to a duel.

01:21:58.375 --> 01:22:01.042
Thank you for letting me have your son
for a few hours.

01:22:01.125 --> 01:22:05.125
I look forward to learning more about the
one that providence has placed in my path.

01:22:05.208 --> 01:22:07.750
I am participating in the hunt
of Baron Danglars on Sunday.

01:22:07.833 --> 01:22:09.208
Join us.

01:22:09.833 --> 01:22:13.708
I can't, I have to welcome
the son of Prince Cavalcanti.

01:22:13.875 --> 01:22:17.292
Come both of you then.
There will be enough deer.

01:22:18.458 --> 01:22:19.625
See you soon.

01:22:20.458 --> 01:22:21.875
On Sunday, I hope.

01:22:24.667 --> 01:22:26.020
Is everything alright?

01:22:28.458 --> 01:22:33.125
I kept a little metal memento
from my Ottoman stay.

01:24:37.167 --> 01:24:40.000
Do you prefer singing
to the music of weapons?

01:24:44.542 --> 01:24:45.625
Follow me.

01:24:52.250 --> 01:24:53.917
I beg your pardon.

01:24:54.083 --> 01:24:57.292
I did not mean to disrespect
your... your wife.

01:24:58.292 --> 01:25:01.417
Haydée is not my wife.
She is my goddaughter.

01:25:02.333 --> 01:25:03.417
After you.

01:25:04.208 --> 01:25:05.208
Haydée.

01:25:06.625 --> 01:25:08.083
What a wonderful name.

01:25:08.708 --> 01:25:11.000
It is quite a common name in Greece.

01:25:11.417 --> 01:25:15.792
It could be translated
as... modesty or... innocence.

01:25:22.417 --> 01:25:25.208
May I ask you to introduce me to Haydée?

01:25:28.167 --> 01:25:30.750
You seem to be a trustworthy young man.

01:25:30.917 --> 01:25:34.800
So, I will introduce you to Haydée,
but you must make me a promise.

01:25:34.917 --> 01:25:36.447
I promise you in advance.

01:25:37.417 --> 01:25:38.792
I am not joking.

01:25:41.292 --> 01:25:43.417
Never seek to seduce her.

01:25:44.917 --> 01:25:47.042
So you think me dangerous?

01:25:47.375 --> 01:25:48.375
No.

01:25:49.375 --> 01:25:50.542
But she is.

01:25:52.458 --> 01:25:55.958
If you do not keep your promise,
she will break your heart

01:25:56.750 --> 01:25:57.750
and her own.

01:25:58.500 --> 01:26:01.458
- But...
- She is not yet ready to love.

01:26:01.917 --> 01:26:05.042
The secret of her voice lies in her past.

01:26:05.208 --> 01:26:09.750
After her father's assassination,
she was sold to a Wallachian tribe.

01:26:10.042 --> 01:26:13.042
That is where I met her and took her in.

01:26:13.208 --> 01:26:16.208
You know, there are sorrows and wounds

01:26:16.375 --> 01:26:18.417
that take years to heal.

01:26:19.208 --> 01:26:21.875
They leave a veil over the souls.

01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:27.875
Never try to lift that veil, Albert.

01:26:30.208 --> 01:26:31.542
I promise you.

01:26:34.208 --> 01:26:35.208
Good.

01:26:35.292 --> 01:26:38.000
You will walk softly,
without a glance at us.

01:26:38.167 --> 01:26:40.638
You will only turn around when I call you.

01:26:43.083 --> 01:26:44.083
Haydée.

01:26:48.917 --> 01:26:51.388
Albert de Morcerf,
I present to you Haydée.

01:26:52.375 --> 01:26:53.375
Delighted.

01:26:53.958 --> 01:26:55.125
Delighted.

01:26:57.750 --> 01:26:59.250
Delighted, miss.

01:26:59.417 --> 01:27:01.712
And what if he doesn't try to meet me?

01:27:01.958 --> 01:27:02.958
He will.

01:27:04.875 --> 01:27:06.125
Stand tall!

01:27:06.292 --> 01:27:08.542
Standing straight is surviving.

01:27:08.708 --> 01:27:11.583
Hiding that you grew up in poverty,
is surviving.

01:27:11.750 --> 01:27:13.792
Do you understand? Why, André?

01:27:15.292 --> 01:27:17.792
Because I am Prince Andrea Cavalcanti.

01:27:18.917 --> 01:27:21.459
- Cavalcanti, doesn't that mean goat?
- What?

01:27:21.542 --> 01:27:24.458
Don't look surprised.
Do you hear me say "what"?

01:27:24.625 --> 01:27:25.625
Start again.

01:27:27.208 --> 01:27:29.625
I am Prince Andrea Cavalcanti.

01:27:30.292 --> 01:27:33.208
You don't have an accent, prince.
How come?

01:27:33.750 --> 01:27:37.208
A very strict teacher
made me lose it with a stick.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:39.708
Impertinence. Your elbows.

01:27:43.958 --> 01:27:45.000
Dear count,

01:27:45.167 --> 01:27:48.417
- I am pleased to meet you.
- Allow me a confession.

01:27:48.583 --> 01:27:52.417
French life is still unknown to me,
I beg your pardon

01:27:52.583 --> 01:27:55.875
if my manners seem
too Slavic, Neapolitan, or Arab.

01:28:04.958 --> 01:28:07.208
Barking

01:28:30.708 --> 01:28:35.250
Here is Count of Monte-Cristo
and Prince Andrea Cavalcanti.

01:28:36.833 --> 01:28:39.000
- Gentlemen.
- Count.

01:28:40.292 --> 01:28:41.292
Prince.

01:28:42.375 --> 01:28:45.167
The meeting with your father,
as overwhelming as it is,

01:28:45.250 --> 01:28:48.917
must not divert you from your target:
Baron Danglars.

01:28:49.083 --> 01:28:52.542
Thanks to stolen boats,
he made a fortune in slavery.

01:28:52.708 --> 01:28:56.000
- Your reputation precedes you.
- Don't trust his smile.

01:28:56.167 --> 01:28:59.579
He is brutal. Not only is he aware of it,
he's proud of it.

01:28:59.667 --> 01:29:01.375
May I confess something to you?

01:29:01.458 --> 01:29:06.333
French life is still unknown to me,
I would ask you to excuse me

01:29:06.500 --> 01:29:10.333
if my manners seem
too Slavic, Neapolitan, or Arab.

01:29:11.958 --> 01:29:14.625
When one is rich,
one is never too anything.

01:29:14.792 --> 01:29:16.125
His daughter is his weak point.

01:29:16.208 --> 01:29:17.208
Prince.

01:29:18.042 --> 01:29:18.750
Baron.

01:29:18.917 --> 01:29:20.542
- Eugénie.
- Is the ground good?

01:29:20.625 --> 01:29:23.042
- It's perfect.
- Then let's go.

01:29:23.667 --> 01:29:25.079
On horseback, gentlemen.

01:30:59.333 --> 01:31:00.792
Your honor, Count.

01:31:02.208 --> 01:31:03.542
Thank you,

01:31:03.708 --> 01:31:05.708
but I swore long ago

01:31:05.875 --> 01:31:08.542
to only kill in self-defense.

01:31:08.708 --> 01:31:10.708
Then let me take your defense.

01:31:12.958 --> 01:31:13.958
Perfect.

01:31:15.083 --> 01:31:16.083
Prince.

01:31:17.333 --> 01:31:18.542
Please.

01:32:02.625 --> 01:32:03.802
Let's go have lunch.

01:32:18.917 --> 01:32:19.917
Eugénie?

01:32:23.542 --> 01:32:27.084
Thank you. Suzanne, I present to you
Prince Andrea Cavalcanti,

01:32:27.167 --> 01:32:29.292
Monte-Cristo's Italian protégé.

01:32:29.458 --> 01:32:30.792
He looks after me.

01:32:30.958 --> 01:32:34.000
My father fears that the beauties of Paris
will lead me to make foolish decisions.

01:32:34.083 --> 01:32:35.750
You speak perfect French.

01:32:35.917 --> 01:32:40.500
A very strict teacher made me
lose my accent with a stick.

01:32:40.875 --> 01:32:43.833
- But that's awful.
- That's false, mostly.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.292
- My mother is French.
- What an idiot.

01:32:47.167 --> 01:32:50.000
I'm glad you could join us.

01:32:50.167 --> 01:32:52.792
Your protégé's hand didn't tremble.

01:32:52.958 --> 01:32:54.584
The animal didn't even suffer.

01:32:54.667 --> 01:32:57.844
And it's a specialist in executions
who speaks to you.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.417
Do you often chop off heads?

01:33:00.583 --> 01:33:03.334
Much less than before.
The trend is towards leniency.

01:33:03.417 --> 01:33:08.167
Excuse me for stealing the Count away,
but I want to introduce him to someone.

01:33:09.292 --> 01:33:10.469
- Count.
- Gentlemen.

01:33:28.667 --> 01:33:30.500
Muffled conversation

01:33:33.417 --> 01:33:34.417
Dear.

01:33:35.042 --> 01:33:37.917
I finally introduce you
to Count of Monte-Cristo.

01:33:41.417 --> 01:33:44.250
Madame de Morcerf. My respects.

01:33:48.375 --> 01:33:49.846
Is everything all right?

01:33:51.250 --> 01:33:52.583
Yes, it's...

01:33:54.708 --> 01:33:59.000
It's the emotion of meeting the man
without whom I would be in tears.

01:34:00.833 --> 01:34:03.375
Sir, I owe you my son's life,

01:34:04.250 --> 01:34:06.417
and for this kindness, I bless you.

01:34:08.250 --> 01:34:11.667
You reward me too generously
for a simple act.

01:34:12.417 --> 01:34:15.333
But I am happy
to have spared you the sorrow.

01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:18.084
I proposed to the Count to be our guest,

01:34:18.167 --> 01:34:20.542
but he has so far refused.

01:34:22.625 --> 01:34:24.625
Perhaps you will have better luck?

01:34:28.292 --> 01:34:32.116
Will you do me the pleasure and honor
of being our guest one day?

01:34:32.667 --> 01:34:34.375
Certainly, madam.

01:34:36.417 --> 01:34:39.888
Permit me to take my leave.
I would hate to monopolize you.

01:34:52.750 --> 01:34:55.167
But... what is happening?

01:34:56.542 --> 01:34:58.500
Would you like me to call someone?

01:34:58.583 --> 01:34:59.667
Albert.

01:35:00.708 --> 01:35:02.591
What do you know about this man?

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:05.000
Mother.

01:35:06.042 --> 01:35:09.125
You always distrust my new acquaintances,

01:35:09.292 --> 01:35:11.125
but the Count saved my life.

01:35:11.292 --> 01:35:12.917
He is as rich as a king.

01:35:13.625 --> 01:35:15.500
What should I fear from him?

01:35:18.583 --> 01:35:19.875
You are right.

01:35:20.500 --> 01:35:22.083
My fears are foolish.

01:36:34.583 --> 01:36:36.125
Mr. Attorney General,

01:36:36.292 --> 01:36:39.750
it is on my honor, as a
lieutenant of the royal armies,

01:36:39.917 --> 01:36:42.625
that I attest here
that the named Edmond Dantès

01:36:42.792 --> 01:36:45.675
has shown in my presence
and on numerous occasions

01:36:45.792 --> 01:36:47.625
sympathy for the usurper

01:36:47.792 --> 01:36:51.583
and his desire to take up arms
to overthrow the monarchy.

01:36:52.125 --> 01:36:54.875
These words weigh heavily on me
because Edmond Dantès was my friend,

01:36:54.958 --> 01:36:57.750
but I cannot let this crime go unpunished.

01:36:57.917 --> 01:37:01.682
I have seen too many men die
because of traitors to the homeland.

01:37:01.792 --> 01:37:04.250
That is not how you will find sleep.

01:37:04.417 --> 01:37:06.250
I wasn't looking for it.

01:37:08.167 --> 01:37:10.042
Do you fear your nightmares?

01:37:13.083 --> 01:37:15.167
I fear not having them anymore.

01:37:16.375 --> 01:37:19.583
They help me keep my wounds open.

01:37:24.292 --> 01:37:25.763
Have you seen her again?

01:37:27.125 --> 01:37:28.125
Yes.

01:37:31.542 --> 01:37:34.013
Was she as beautiful as in your memories?

01:37:37.583 --> 01:37:40.375
I thought that grief
would have changed her.

01:37:43.625 --> 01:37:45.542
It must have been short-lived.

01:37:47.458 --> 01:37:50.811
Her eyes were not those
of a woman who has cried too much.

01:37:57.792 --> 01:38:01.675
She will find the taste for tears
when they take her husband away.

01:38:29.750 --> 01:38:30.750
I'm passing.

01:38:31.792 --> 01:38:32.792
200...

01:38:33.667 --> 01:38:34.750
plus 500.

01:38:36.083 --> 01:38:37.208
I fold.

01:38:37.375 --> 01:38:40.787
I wouldn't invite you to my table
if you knew how to play.

01:38:41.792 --> 01:38:42.792
There you go.

01:38:43.750 --> 01:38:45.633
There are only three of us left.

01:38:47.208 --> 01:38:49.083
I'll leave you two alone.

01:38:54.083 --> 01:38:55.083
Two pairs.

01:38:56.500 --> 01:38:57.500
Well done.

01:39:00.042 --> 01:39:01.042
Color.

01:39:02.750 --> 01:39:04.515
You have far too many hearts.

01:39:04.625 --> 01:39:06.625
I'm fleeing before I ruin my father.

01:39:06.708 --> 01:39:09.532
- Come on, let's go, Albert.
- Yes, that's right,

01:39:09.625 --> 01:39:13.208
- go see those ladies.
- Unlucky at cards, lucky in love.

01:39:16.917 --> 01:39:18.708
I like your prince very much.

01:39:18.875 --> 01:39:19.875
He is charming.

01:39:20.083 --> 01:39:24.375
I barely know him, to be honest.
His father is a business associate.

01:39:26.208 --> 01:39:28.091
A good family, without a doubt.

01:39:28.542 --> 01:39:32.875
If by "good," you mean "rich," then
yes, it's the second fortune of Italy.

01:39:32.958 --> 01:39:34.042
Hm...

01:39:34.500 --> 01:39:35.958
The second?

01:39:36.917 --> 01:39:38.542
So you know the first?

01:39:39.375 --> 01:39:40.787
Don't make me immodest.

01:39:41.667 --> 01:39:43.792
Finally, people richer than me.

01:39:45.958 --> 01:39:49.125
His family dreams of seeing him marry
a girl in Paris, but...

01:39:49.208 --> 01:39:52.333
if the son is as fickle as the father,
beware.

01:39:52.792 --> 01:39:54.208
Rest assured,

01:39:54.708 --> 01:39:57.083
I distrust everyone in general.

01:39:57.833 --> 01:40:00.250
And foreigners, in particular.

01:40:01.792 --> 01:40:03.263
I am a foreigner myself.

01:40:03.750 --> 01:40:06.574
You, Count, that doesn't count.
You are a count.

01:40:07.042 --> 01:40:08.917
And besides, it rhymes, you see?

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:09.917
You are a poet.

01:40:10.083 --> 01:40:12.201
By the way, speaking of foreigners,

01:40:12.292 --> 01:40:14.645
L'Impartial was bought by an Englishman.

01:40:14.833 --> 01:40:15.833
Absolutely,

01:40:15.958 --> 01:40:18.875
a certain Halifax.
A Lord, it seems.

01:40:20.625 --> 01:40:23.792
He buys newspapers to spread false news

01:40:23.958 --> 01:40:25.334
and speculate on the stock market.

01:40:25.417 --> 01:40:27.375
He is a rogue of the worst kind.

01:40:28.792 --> 01:40:31.542
You don't seem to like
this Lord very much.

01:40:31.708 --> 01:40:34.167
Let's just say I like many people,

01:40:34.333 --> 01:40:37.000
but I only truly hate certain individuals.

01:40:37.167 --> 01:40:40.542
Hating an Englishman is not a sin.
It's common sense.

01:40:44.792 --> 01:40:46.263
Are you leaving already?

01:40:46.583 --> 01:40:50.113
It's almost midnight.
Our carriage will turn into a pumpkin.

01:40:55.333 --> 01:40:56.417
Albert.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:57.833
Miss.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
You were about to forget your fan.

01:41:05.875 --> 01:41:07.083
Thank you, sir.

01:41:11.708 --> 01:41:14.583
- Can I count on you?
- For what?

01:41:15.583 --> 01:41:16.917
To join me for dinner

01:41:17.083 --> 01:41:20.554
that I am organizing soon in Paris.
I found a place to stay.

01:41:22.167 --> 01:41:23.708
Well... Of course.

01:41:24.542 --> 01:41:25.542
Good.

01:41:26.833 --> 01:41:27.917
See you soon.

01:41:35.458 --> 01:41:36.708
Count.

01:41:38.500 --> 01:41:39.875
Madame de Morcerf.

01:41:41.417 --> 01:41:43.209
You're leaving just as I arrive.

01:41:43.292 --> 01:41:44.822
Don't see any connection.

01:41:46.167 --> 01:41:47.932
I wanted to apologize to you.

01:41:50.083 --> 01:41:51.500
Apologize to me?

01:41:52.417 --> 01:41:54.333
For my dizziness the other day.

01:41:55.125 --> 01:41:59.042
You reminded me of someone
I once knew well who disappeared

01:41:59.208 --> 01:42:00.917
under tragic circumstances.

01:42:04.875 --> 01:42:06.792
For a moment, I...

01:42:13.708 --> 01:42:16.542
It's happening again,
I can't find my words.

01:42:18.833 --> 01:42:22.708
I'm sorry to have reminded you
of that painful memory.

01:42:25.667 --> 01:42:27.667
Rest assured, it has dissipated.

01:42:31.208 --> 01:42:32.333
Good.

01:42:35.042 --> 01:42:36.792
I wish you a good evening.

01:42:38.042 --> 01:42:39.208
Count.

01:42:58.083 --> 01:42:59.083
Albert.

01:43:06.625 --> 01:43:07.625
"Haydée.

01:43:08.042 --> 01:43:11.458
"I'm not supposed to write to you.
So I won't write to you.

01:43:12.958 --> 01:43:14.708
"I must not meet you..."

01:43:14.875 --> 01:43:18.287
So I won't suggest
that we meet at the Jardin des Plantes,

01:43:18.375 --> 01:43:20.042
tomorrow at 5 o'clock.

01:43:20.417 --> 01:43:22.750
This place, where I won't be tomorrow,

01:43:22.917 --> 01:43:25.500
holds the most mysterious flowers
of Paris.

01:43:26.375 --> 01:43:30.375
You come from a country nicknamed
the land of clouds and jasmine.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.750
We can count on the Parisian sky
for the clouds,

01:43:33.833 --> 01:43:35.792
I'll have jasmine in my buttonhole.

01:43:35.875 --> 01:43:38.208
So I won't say see you tomorrow.

01:43:38.375 --> 01:43:40.846
And I won't tell you that since I saw you,

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:44.125
your voice and your face
have not left my mind.

01:43:44.750 --> 01:43:45.750
Albert.

01:43:51.167 --> 01:43:52.875
Is he going to report us?

01:43:53.042 --> 01:43:54.866
He is very loyal to the Count,

01:43:54.958 --> 01:43:57.208
but he has a weakness for me.

01:44:00.625 --> 01:44:03.125
It's a strelitzia (Bird
of paradise flower).

01:44:03.208 --> 01:44:06.914
Where I come from, there were some
on a path leading to the sea.

01:44:07.792 --> 01:44:10.028
It's also called the bird of paradise,

01:44:10.625 --> 01:44:12.583
(In Romanian)
bird of paradise.

01:44:12.750 --> 01:44:14.708
(In Romanian)
Bird of paradise?

01:44:15.375 --> 01:44:16.375
Exactly.

01:44:22.833 --> 01:44:25.500
How is it that you don't have a fiancée?

01:44:25.667 --> 01:44:27.708
But maybe you do?

01:44:28.750 --> 01:44:31.868
My father wants me to
marry the daughter of a baron.

01:44:32.125 --> 01:44:33.417
But I...

01:44:33.750 --> 01:44:37.209
I'm looking for something
that this young lady will never have.

01:44:37.292 --> 01:44:42.875
That... indefinable charm that is to a
woman what fragrance is to a flower.

01:44:44.042 --> 01:44:46.458
Or what flavor is to fruit.

01:44:47.083 --> 01:44:50.250
I don't know if Parisian women
like to be picked or tasted,

01:44:50.333 --> 01:44:51.333
but not me.

01:44:52.542 --> 01:44:55.292
- That's not what I meant.
- I was teasing you.

01:44:56.125 --> 01:44:58.831
Will you be at the Count's
dinner on Saturday?

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.530
No. I will serve as
an alibi for my mother

01:45:01.625 --> 01:45:04.037
who avoids social events like the plague.

01:45:04.333 --> 01:45:05.333
And you?

01:45:06.583 --> 01:45:08.292
I don't know your mother,

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:10.792
I don't know her tastes,

01:45:11.333 --> 01:45:12.804
but I share her dislikes.

01:45:17.667 --> 01:45:20.609
Neither he nor his mother
will come to the dinner.

01:45:20.833 --> 01:45:23.657
But Fernand de Morcerf
will certainly be present.

01:45:30.667 --> 01:45:31.917
What's the matter?

01:45:33.667 --> 01:45:36.197
Are you not going to tell me about Albert?

01:45:38.500 --> 01:45:40.333
There's nothing to say.

01:45:52.667 --> 01:45:54.250
It's normal to doubt.

01:45:56.208 --> 01:45:58.875
To be afraid. I understand that.

01:46:00.750 --> 01:46:03.339
But when the time comes,
you must remember...

01:46:03.583 --> 01:46:04.875
I don't need you

01:46:05.042 --> 01:46:07.708
to remind me of what
his father did to mine.

01:46:15.167 --> 01:46:17.167
He placed his lips there.

01:46:39.708 --> 01:46:40.333
Thank you,

01:46:40.500 --> 01:46:41.833
- my dear.
- Of course.

01:46:44.750 --> 01:46:45.958
Dear friends.

01:46:54.292 --> 01:46:55.750
Good evening, Victoria.

01:46:59.833 --> 01:47:02.128
I expected something more spectacular,

01:47:02.292 --> 01:47:04.084
there's no need to make that face.

01:47:04.167 --> 01:47:06.667
There must be surprises inside.

01:47:24.292 --> 01:47:25.625
Hm...

01:47:30.708 --> 01:47:33.250
You seem to have little appetite.

01:47:33.625 --> 01:47:36.508
I had an appetite before the pig
and the poultry.

01:47:37.292 --> 01:47:40.375
This house is... magnificent.

01:47:41.083 --> 01:47:43.042
I sense you are still surprised.

01:47:43.583 --> 01:47:45.042
Nothing escapes you.

01:47:47.167 --> 01:47:51.042
I thought a man like you
would choose a more central neighborhood,

01:47:51.208 --> 01:47:54.667
like... the Champs-Élysées
or Saint-Germain.

01:47:54.833 --> 01:47:58.481
I bought this house precisely
because it was advised against.

01:47:58.792 --> 01:47:59.792
Why?

01:48:00.667 --> 01:48:03.667
Well, they say it's haunted.
Gasps from the guests

01:48:03.833 --> 01:48:08.000
They say a crime occurred here...
an abominable one, years ago.

01:48:08.167 --> 01:48:10.875
Be careful,
we have the King's prosecutor here.

01:48:10.958 --> 01:48:11.958
It's true.

01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:15.971
A child was said to have been sacrificed.

01:48:16.958 --> 01:48:18.083
That's dreadful.

01:48:18.792 --> 01:48:21.417
You bought this house despite everything?

01:48:21.583 --> 01:48:22.917
You did well.

01:48:23.083 --> 01:48:25.917
These ghost stories are nonsense

01:48:26.083 --> 01:48:28.292
invented by malicious servants.

01:48:28.667 --> 01:48:29.903
Or jealous neighbors.

01:48:30.625 --> 01:48:32.449
Don't be mistaken, prosecutor.

01:48:32.542 --> 01:48:35.000
I lived in Asia and the Indies,

01:48:35.500 --> 01:48:39.542
and it's hard to return
without knowing that there indeed exists

01:48:39.708 --> 01:48:40.917
a world...

01:48:41.083 --> 01:48:42.966
invisible, populated by spirits.

01:48:44.583 --> 01:48:47.417
When I visited this house, I...

01:48:48.042 --> 01:48:49.542
I immediately knew...

01:48:51.042 --> 01:48:55.208
I had the strange conviction
that a crime had been committed here.

01:48:56.625 --> 01:48:57.875
So I asked

01:48:58.042 --> 01:49:00.292
- to be left alone.
- But...

01:49:00.458 --> 01:49:01.667
were you not afraid?

01:49:02.500 --> 01:49:05.875
If your conscience is pure,
ghosts do not haunt you.

01:49:06.042 --> 01:49:07.101
They speak to you.

01:49:07.667 --> 01:49:12.125
- And what did they tell you?
- But yes, what did they tell you?

01:49:15.250 --> 01:49:19.542
That night, I settled here.

01:49:19.708 --> 01:49:21.875
Right in front of this fireplace.

01:49:23.542 --> 01:49:26.917
I smoked a bit of opium
to be more receptive.

01:49:27.458 --> 01:49:31.458
There's nothing like it to expand
the spectrum of your consciousness.

01:49:34.042 --> 01:49:36.167
And in the sweetness of the smoke...

01:49:38.292 --> 01:49:41.542
I felt as if... suspended.

01:49:43.917 --> 01:49:46.042
I hear a knock in the walls.

01:49:47.542 --> 01:49:48.708
Then a second.

01:49:52.333 --> 01:49:53.792
I place my hand.

01:49:54.250 --> 01:49:58.625
And I hear screams coming from upstairs.
I go up the stairs.

01:50:00.375 --> 01:50:03.250
The screams turn into... moans.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:06.750
It comes from a room

01:50:06.917 --> 01:50:08.447
at the end of the hallway.

01:50:10.333 --> 01:50:13.083
I push the door
and find myself in a bedroom.

01:50:13.250 --> 01:50:14.956
In the middle, there's a bed.

01:50:15.333 --> 01:50:16.628
I place my hand on it.

01:50:19.833 --> 01:50:21.958
And I see a woman writhing in pain.

01:50:22.542 --> 01:50:27.667
She is giving birth to a child.
She is alone, abandoned.

01:50:27.958 --> 01:50:28.958
She screams.

01:50:31.667 --> 01:50:34.458
And then I feel a presence behind me.

01:50:35.250 --> 01:50:36.250
All of a sudden.

01:50:36.375 --> 01:50:39.333
It knocks on the table.
Victoria screams.

01:50:39.500 --> 01:50:41.089
You frighten these ladies.

01:50:41.208 --> 01:50:42.750
And you entertain us.

01:50:43.042 --> 01:50:44.958
Continue, I beg you.

01:50:45.125 --> 01:50:47.750
Get a hold of yourself,
you're ruining the party.

01:50:47.833 --> 01:50:50.667
I turn around, trembling.

01:50:52.375 --> 01:50:53.583
And at that moment,

01:50:53.750 --> 01:50:56.792
I hear a whisper in my ear.

01:50:58.500 --> 01:51:00.083
It's the voice of a child.

01:51:01.708 --> 01:51:03.459
The voice of a child begging me

01:51:03.542 --> 01:51:04.667
to set him free.

01:51:06.583 --> 01:51:08.583
I finally find a door,

01:51:09.083 --> 01:51:11.583
a hidden door that I hadn't seen.

01:51:12.542 --> 01:51:13.667
I push it open.

01:51:14.417 --> 01:51:17.167
Stairs... They lead to the garden.

01:51:18.333 --> 01:51:20.750
And the child's voice returned.

01:51:20.917 --> 01:51:25.042
He told me he had been alone
for so long. He was crying.

01:51:25.542 --> 01:51:26.954
He calls for his mother.

01:51:32.083 --> 01:51:33.500
That night, I...

01:51:34.417 --> 01:51:35.958
I searched, but...

01:51:37.417 --> 01:51:39.208
the garden was too big.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:42.792
What... What did you do?

01:51:52.125 --> 01:51:53.208
Pardon?

01:51:54.583 --> 01:51:56.113
The garden was too big...

01:51:57.083 --> 01:51:58.333
What did you do?

01:52:00.458 --> 01:52:01.458
Yes.

01:52:12.083 --> 01:52:14.333
The next morning, we dug.

01:52:14.875 --> 01:52:16.042
Everywhere.

01:52:16.792 --> 01:52:20.042
We uprooted the apple trees,
turned over the path...

01:52:20.875 --> 01:52:21.875
And nothing.

01:52:24.417 --> 01:52:27.458
So I had a truffle pig
brought in from Périgord.

01:52:29.375 --> 01:52:30.375
And then?

01:52:33.083 --> 01:52:35.319
Since it didn't find anything either,

01:52:36.042 --> 01:52:37.667
we ate it that evening.

01:52:37.833 --> 01:52:39.750
Wonderful!

01:52:41.833 --> 01:52:44.375
I did say it was just a fable.

01:52:45.208 --> 01:52:47.167
A fable, exactly.

01:52:48.083 --> 01:52:51.000
At least, that's what I believed.
Until yesterday.

01:52:52.708 --> 01:52:54.167
While we were planting

01:52:54.333 --> 01:52:56.417
the torches for the reception,

01:52:57.083 --> 01:52:59.167
one of them broke clean.

01:53:00.875 --> 01:53:03.000
We dug at that spot and...

01:53:04.333 --> 01:53:05.750
we discovered a chest.

01:53:06.208 --> 01:53:07.375
And then?

01:53:09.208 --> 01:53:10.833
What was inside?

01:53:12.542 --> 01:53:13.750
I don't know.

01:53:13.917 --> 01:53:14.976
What do you mean?

01:53:17.042 --> 01:53:19.542
I waited for you... to open it.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:38.750
And what if there's a body?

01:53:40.167 --> 01:53:41.750
We will give it a burial.

01:53:47.292 --> 01:53:49.167
Prosecutor, perhaps you'd like

01:53:49.333 --> 01:53:50.333
to open it?

01:53:54.042 --> 01:53:56.417
- I beg you, don't open it.
- Enough.

01:54:19.125 --> 01:54:20.958
Abracadabra!

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:26.167
Oh, I don't know

01:54:26.333 --> 01:54:29.292
what's true in this story,
but you are a magician,

01:54:29.458 --> 01:54:30.708
count.

01:54:36.625 --> 01:54:39.861
How is it possible?
He spoke as if he had been present.

01:54:40.458 --> 01:54:43.375
All those details, it was...
I thought I was going crazy.

01:54:43.458 --> 01:54:45.208
Calm down, please.

01:54:45.375 --> 01:54:47.834
- Where is our child's body?
- I don't know.

01:54:47.917 --> 01:54:50.125
- You had placed it there, right?
- Yes.

01:54:50.208 --> 01:54:52.708
You told me he was dead!
You told me!

01:54:52.875 --> 01:54:54.500
Of course, he was dead.

01:54:54.667 --> 01:54:57.000
- Then where is he?
- I don't know.

01:54:57.167 --> 01:54:59.285
- Where is our child?
- I don't know!

01:54:59.375 --> 01:55:02.792
Be quiet, you are hysterical!
I don't know.

01:55:02.958 --> 01:55:05.083
Calm down.

01:55:06.917 --> 01:55:08.292
I know one thing.

01:55:08.917 --> 01:55:10.565
It's that within eight days,

01:55:10.667 --> 01:55:13.079
I will know who this Mr. Monte-Cristo is,

01:55:13.542 --> 01:55:16.417
where he comes from, where he's going,

01:55:16.917 --> 01:55:20.292
and why he speaks before us
of buried children.

01:55:24.625 --> 01:55:26.417
Danglars is obsessed with money.

01:55:26.500 --> 01:55:28.042
He won't be wary of someone

01:55:28.125 --> 01:55:30.125
who asks for none.
Morcerf trusts me

01:55:30.208 --> 01:55:32.208
since I saved his son.

01:55:32.375 --> 01:55:33.728
Then there's Villefort.

01:55:33.917 --> 01:55:35.459
Villefort is the prosecutor.

01:55:35.542 --> 01:55:36.583
He is suspicious.

01:55:37.833 --> 01:55:41.583
And thanks to this dinner,
Victoria will demand explanations.

01:55:41.750 --> 01:55:44.125
So to reassure her and reassure himself,

01:55:44.292 --> 01:55:46.234
he will conduct an investigation.

01:55:46.583 --> 01:55:50.250
And since we always learn more
from malicious tongues,

01:55:50.417 --> 01:55:52.708
it's the count's enemy he will visit.

01:55:53.333 --> 01:55:54.708
Lord Halifax.

01:55:55.208 --> 01:55:57.542
(English accent)
What do you want to know?

01:55:57.625 --> 01:56:01.875
If I can harm him, it will be my pleasure.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:06.458
Has the count ever been to Paris?
He claims he hasn't.

01:56:06.625 --> 01:56:09.625
If he had already come, I would know.

01:56:10.042 --> 01:56:13.917
But then, do you know
where he was 15 years ago?

01:56:17.917 --> 01:56:18.750
But...

01:56:18.917 --> 01:56:20.208
I must say,

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.417
at that time, he still amused me.

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:27.667
But after...

01:56:28.833 --> 01:56:29.958
After what?

01:56:31.333 --> 01:56:35.125
Well, one evening I
was correcting a servant

01:56:35.292 --> 01:56:37.125
who had it coming.

01:56:38.042 --> 01:56:39.125
But...

01:56:39.667 --> 01:56:43.458
Monte-Cristo had taken a passion
for those savages,

01:56:43.625 --> 01:56:48.500
with their pagan gods, their absurd magic.

01:56:48.667 --> 01:56:50.167
Ridiculous beliefs.

01:56:52.667 --> 01:56:54.542
So he challenged me to a duel.

01:56:55.583 --> 01:56:56.667
For a native?

01:56:56.833 --> 01:56:59.917
Yes! A native!

01:57:00.083 --> 01:57:01.708
Can you believe it?

01:57:01.875 --> 01:57:03.958
Ah.

01:57:04.583 --> 01:57:07.083
It's hot, don't you think?
What heat!

01:57:07.250 --> 01:57:10.125
Someone bring me my fan,
for heaven's sake!

01:57:11.042 --> 01:57:12.708
We're suffocating in here!

01:57:14.750 --> 01:57:16.375
Not that one.

01:57:16.875 --> 01:57:18.083
Thank you.

01:57:22.208 --> 01:57:23.708
Hm. And you,

01:57:24.833 --> 01:57:26.250
Mr. Villefort?

01:57:27.292 --> 01:57:28.704
What has he done to you?

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:30.000
Nothing.

01:57:31.375 --> 01:57:35.023
I don't know if I should count him
among my friends or enemies.

01:57:35.833 --> 01:57:39.542
If he were your enemy,
you would know already.

01:57:39.708 --> 01:57:43.750
He has flaws, but he's not
the type to hide his intentions.

01:57:43.917 --> 01:57:44.917
Hm.

01:57:45.583 --> 01:57:46.583
But...

01:57:47.208 --> 01:57:48.583
be careful.

01:57:48.750 --> 01:57:50.000
Mr. Prosecutor.

01:57:52.042 --> 01:57:54.208
If he becomes your friend,

01:57:54.708 --> 01:57:57.875
that will make you my enemy.

01:57:59.708 --> 01:58:00.917
Of course.

01:58:08.833 --> 01:58:10.375
Yes.

01:58:10.542 --> 01:58:13.500
Thank you, Mr. Villefort,
it was very pleasant

01:58:13.667 --> 01:58:16.583
to talk with you, but I have much to do.

01:58:16.750 --> 01:58:17.917
I thank you.

01:58:19.292 --> 01:58:20.917
Mr. Prosecutor.

01:58:30.208 --> 01:58:31.208
Victor.

01:58:33.042 --> 01:58:34.042
Count?

01:58:34.208 --> 01:58:36.503
Prepare the horses, we are going back.

01:58:47.542 --> 01:58:49.750
Now that Villefort has let his guard down,

01:58:49.833 --> 01:58:52.167
we can prepare our attack.

01:58:53.542 --> 01:58:54.917
I'm heading south.

01:58:55.083 --> 01:58:58.848
I'll return for Danglars' party
for his daughter's 20th birthday.

01:58:59.250 --> 01:59:00.427
I'm counting on you,

01:59:00.583 --> 01:59:02.583
André, to get close to her.

01:59:03.625 --> 01:59:06.333
And on you, Haydée, to enchant Albert.

01:59:09.750 --> 01:59:11.167
Go ahead.

01:59:12.583 --> 01:59:14.000
Good.

01:59:14.167 --> 01:59:18.125
It can hold up to 600 slaves,
700 if pushed a bit, but...

01:59:18.292 --> 01:59:20.083
I am a humanitarian.

01:59:20.250 --> 01:59:21.750
I named it Hercules.

01:59:21.917 --> 01:59:26.458
My mother said that's the line
of people destined for great things.

01:59:27.208 --> 01:59:30.583
And this is your... love line.

01:59:31.667 --> 01:59:33.792
And here, I read that...

01:59:34.542 --> 01:59:36.542
I need to tell you something.

01:59:43.500 --> 01:59:44.500
Yes?

01:59:47.542 --> 01:59:49.072
I would like to love you,

01:59:49.500 --> 01:59:52.125
- but I can't.
- I know.

01:59:55.083 --> 01:59:56.208
You won't offer me

01:59:56.375 --> 01:59:58.625
the feelings you have for Suzanne.

01:59:58.792 --> 02:00:00.084
It will be our secret.

02:00:00.167 --> 02:00:02.833
It will be our secret.
It will be well kept.

02:00:03.250 --> 02:00:05.368
I know what it's like to be double.

02:00:06.083 --> 02:00:08.201
I know what it's like to be double.

02:00:09.167 --> 02:00:11.167
Not being able to say who you are.

02:00:13.375 --> 02:00:14.625
I will be your alibi.

02:00:57.042 --> 02:00:59.278
The time has come to redeem yourself.

02:01:46.750 --> 02:01:48.042
I relive in dreams

02:01:48.208 --> 02:01:50.503
every second of those moments with you.

02:01:50.917 --> 02:01:53.859
I will carry into my night
the memory of your eyes,

02:01:54.833 --> 02:01:56.709
and I don't want to speak to anyone

02:01:56.792 --> 02:01:58.917
to not waste the echo of your words

02:01:59.083 --> 02:02:00.966
that still trembles in my heart.

02:02:02.208 --> 02:02:04.458
I keep your score close to me.

02:02:05.250 --> 02:02:08.250
I love it for the image
it gives me of you,

02:02:08.417 --> 02:02:12.208
but also and above all for the memory
it will forever hold,

02:02:12.375 --> 02:02:15.792
that of a moment of life
that is worth a whole lifetime.

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:54.883
- See you later.
- See you later.

02:03:07.292 --> 02:03:08.292
Prince.

02:03:12.625 --> 02:03:16.084
Eugénie. This party is a
reflection of you, vibrant and joyful.

02:03:16.167 --> 02:03:17.583
Thank you, Andrea.

02:03:17.750 --> 02:03:21.221
Will you count the Count of Monte Cristo
among your guests?

02:03:21.750 --> 02:03:22.750
17.

02:03:23.208 --> 02:03:24.208
17?

02:03:24.792 --> 02:03:27.209
You are the 17th to ask me that question.

02:03:27.292 --> 02:03:29.250
And what do you answer everyone?

02:03:29.708 --> 02:03:32.708
That there won't be an 18th. Here he is.

02:03:37.292 --> 02:03:38.292
Excuse me.

02:03:44.042 --> 02:03:45.042
Miss.

02:03:45.417 --> 02:03:48.375
- Count. Did you have a good trip?
- Wonderful.

02:03:49.708 --> 02:03:52.083
- Thank you.
- Eugénie is eager

02:03:52.250 --> 02:03:53.875
to see you again, miss.

02:03:54.333 --> 02:03:55.917
Count, may I?

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:58.042
With pleasure.

02:04:06.708 --> 02:04:08.958
Does the count know that we have met?

02:04:09.417 --> 02:04:11.123
I haven't told him anything.

02:04:12.167 --> 02:04:16.000
- Can he have guessed?
- God alone knows what he is capable of.

02:04:17.917 --> 02:04:19.375
Aren't they beautiful?

02:04:21.167 --> 02:04:23.292
They seem so eager to live.

02:04:24.500 --> 02:04:26.542
One is always eager to be happy.

02:04:27.500 --> 02:04:28.500
No?

02:04:32.167 --> 02:04:34.458
Honor me with your arm.

02:04:34.917 --> 02:04:36.583
I want to take a few steps.

02:05:14.708 --> 02:05:16.167
Your hand trembles.

02:05:17.125 --> 02:05:18.625
You seem cold.

02:05:19.250 --> 02:05:22.667
In my family,
we have cold hands but warm hearts.

02:05:23.167 --> 02:05:25.833
Here. This will warm us.

02:05:26.958 --> 02:05:29.000
Our grapes are not as good as in Sicily

02:05:29.083 --> 02:05:32.000
but you will be indulgent
with our northern sun.

02:05:32.292 --> 02:05:33.583
I regret.

02:05:35.875 --> 02:05:38.042
I beg your pardon, but...

02:05:38.875 --> 02:05:40.250
I never drink.

02:05:42.792 --> 02:05:44.734
Will you at least eat something?

02:05:47.042 --> 02:05:49.000
I will have to decline again.

02:05:50.875 --> 02:05:55.208
Mr. Count, there is an Arab custom
that makes friends eternally

02:05:55.375 --> 02:05:58.670
those who have shared bread and salt
under the same roof.

02:05:59.417 --> 02:06:00.833
I know it, madam.

02:06:01.667 --> 02:06:04.083
But we are in Paris and not in Tangier.

02:06:05.042 --> 02:06:09.417
Here, there is no more eternal friendship
than sharing bread and salt.

02:06:31.333 --> 02:06:34.458
But after all...
We are friends, aren't we?

02:06:35.333 --> 02:06:36.583
Of course.

02:06:37.542 --> 02:06:39.250
Why wouldn't we be?

02:06:43.458 --> 02:06:48.375
So, in the absence of bread and salt,
share with me some memories.

02:06:50.875 --> 02:06:52.708
What would you like to know?

02:06:55.208 --> 02:06:57.503
Is it true that you have seen so much,

02:06:57.958 --> 02:06:59.375
traveled so much,

02:06:59.625 --> 02:07:00.875
suffered so much?

02:07:01.667 --> 02:07:03.333
What makes you say that?

02:07:05.208 --> 02:07:06.292
Your eyes.

02:07:09.125 --> 02:07:13.067
There is in every traveler the desire
to find or to flee something.

02:07:15.667 --> 02:07:17.000
Did you find it?

02:07:17.583 --> 02:07:19.407
I haven't finished my journey.

02:07:24.750 --> 02:07:26.083
Do you live alone?

02:07:28.167 --> 02:07:31.292
I have neither sister,
nor son, nor father.

02:07:35.375 --> 02:07:39.833
I only have Haydée
who, I am sure, will leave me soon.

02:07:42.708 --> 02:07:44.833
How can you live like this,

02:07:45.125 --> 02:07:47.184
with nothing that ties you to life?

02:07:51.250 --> 02:07:53.000
I loved a young woman.

02:07:55.958 --> 02:07:57.488
That I was going to marry.

02:08:00.083 --> 02:08:01.625
Years ago.

02:08:02.125 --> 02:08:05.833
But when the war came
and took me far from her...

02:08:10.042 --> 02:08:12.925
I thought she would love me enough
to wait for me.

02:08:17.250 --> 02:08:19.708
To remain faithful to me until the grave.

02:08:23.167 --> 02:08:25.042
But when I returned,

02:08:26.083 --> 02:08:27.458
she was married.

02:08:31.333 --> 02:08:35.375
I may have had a heart weaker than others.

02:08:37.708 --> 02:08:40.083
I suffered more than they would have.

02:08:41.500 --> 02:08:44.559
- That's all.
- That love has remained in your heart?

02:08:47.875 --> 02:08:49.708
We truly love only once.

02:08:51.125 --> 02:08:52.125
Don't we?

02:08:54.625 --> 02:08:56.208
Have you seen her again?

02:09:00.708 --> 02:09:01.708
Never.

02:09:02.833 --> 02:09:04.000
Never?

02:09:08.583 --> 02:09:09.708
Never.

02:09:16.583 --> 02:09:19.292
Have you forgiven her for your suffering?

02:09:21.875 --> 02:09:24.875
One can only forgive
those who ask for forgiveness.

02:09:29.500 --> 02:09:32.030
And if she asked you for forgiveness
today?

02:09:49.625 --> 02:09:52.917
Buy L'Impartial!
The Danglars fleet stolen in Marseille!

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:56.500
L'Impartial, ladies and gentlemen!
L'Impartial!

02:09:56.667 --> 02:09:57.667
Buy!

02:09:57.833 --> 02:10:01.042
How can one steal ships
in a port in broad daylight?

02:10:01.458 --> 02:10:03.084
They were insured, at least?

02:10:03.167 --> 02:10:04.285
What do you think?

02:10:04.625 --> 02:10:07.208
The Danglars stock is crashing.

02:10:08.167 --> 02:10:10.226
But thanks to the army's telegraph,

02:10:10.583 --> 02:10:15.417
Danglars will quickly learn
that nothing really happened.

02:10:15.583 --> 02:10:17.667
You were supposed to steal his ships.

02:10:17.750 --> 02:10:19.750
Everything comes to those who wait.

02:10:19.833 --> 02:10:22.542
You are safe. Your ships are fine.

02:10:22.708 --> 02:10:24.250
- What?
- L'Impartial lied.

02:10:25.625 --> 02:10:29.000
"The Danglars fleet is still

02:10:29.167 --> 02:10:31.750
"afloat, moored in the port of Marseille"!

02:10:33.583 --> 02:10:36.458
Thank you. Thank you, my friends.

02:10:36.958 --> 02:10:39.834
Danglars will remember my words
and he will think...

02:10:39.917 --> 02:10:42.792
That it's a blow from the new owner
of L'Impartial,

02:10:42.875 --> 02:10:44.417
our dear Lord Halifax.

02:10:44.583 --> 02:10:45.583
Exactly.

02:10:46.750 --> 02:10:48.084
Monte-Cristo was right.

02:10:48.167 --> 02:10:51.334
The Englishman uses his newspaper
to speculate at my expense.

02:10:51.417 --> 02:10:53.123
We need to publish a denial.

02:10:55.167 --> 02:10:56.167
Not at all.

02:10:56.500 --> 02:10:58.292
I don't understand. We must...

02:10:58.375 --> 02:10:59.375
Shh!

02:11:00.583 --> 02:11:01.583
Do you hear?

02:11:02.667 --> 02:11:03.667
Listen.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:06.292
The nice sound.

02:11:08.292 --> 02:11:09.833
That nice little sound.

02:11:11.458 --> 02:11:13.667
The sound of money falling.

02:11:14.208 --> 02:11:15.709
I don't understand either.

02:11:15.792 --> 02:11:19.875
Think. He knows something
that no one knows yet.

02:11:20.333 --> 02:11:24.542
Imagine: you're playing poker
and you know your opponent's hand.

02:11:24.958 --> 02:11:26.958
- What do you do?
- I raise.

02:11:27.125 --> 02:11:28.949
The stocks are at rock bottom.

02:11:29.708 --> 02:11:34.458
If I buy them back now, in two days,
I'll make a huge profit.

02:11:34.625 --> 02:11:35.958
My best move.

02:11:36.125 --> 02:11:37.420
Buy back your shares?

02:11:37.750 --> 02:11:39.000
How much would that take?

02:11:39.083 --> 02:11:40.500
- 500 million.
- 500 million?

02:11:40.583 --> 02:11:43.833
500 million.
But it has to be done today.

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:48.167
Before the market closes and before
that scoundrel Halifax does.

02:11:48.542 --> 02:11:51.083
How do we find 500 million
by this evening?

02:11:53.542 --> 02:11:56.837
By going to see the greatest enemy
of that Lord Halifax.

02:12:24.833 --> 02:12:26.750
I'm sorry, Baron, but...

02:12:27.458 --> 02:12:29.753
the sea has always brought me bad luck.

02:12:29.875 --> 02:12:31.581
I won't buy back your stocks.

02:12:31.667 --> 02:12:33.750
- Count.
- However,

02:12:33.917 --> 02:12:37.000
I never refuse to help a friend
and punish an enemy.

02:12:37.167 --> 02:12:40.932
So I will lend you this money
and you can do as you wish with it.

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:47.500
And I can guarantee you
an interest rate of 20%.

02:12:47.958 --> 02:12:50.135
I will lend you money interest-free.

02:12:52.167 --> 02:12:53.000
In Sicily, they say:

02:12:53.167 --> 02:12:55.209
"You won't get rich
at the expense of a friend."

02:12:55.292 --> 02:12:56.542
I insist.

02:12:57.333 --> 02:13:01.250
I had a mortgage drawn up
on all my properties.

02:13:01.417 --> 02:13:04.875
So, it's not for 500 million, but...

02:13:05.250 --> 02:13:07.000
200 million, I promise.

02:13:07.375 --> 02:13:09.584
No, Baron, your word is enough for me.

02:13:09.667 --> 02:13:11.042
In France, they say:

02:13:11.208 --> 02:13:13.375
"Good accounts make good friends."

02:13:15.500 --> 02:13:19.559
Very well then. Out of friendship,
I accept your personal guarantees.

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.125
In a week, I will have repaid you.

02:13:26.458 --> 02:13:29.167
We will make that Halifax pay dearly.

02:13:29.917 --> 02:13:31.417
A complaint is ready.

02:13:32.042 --> 02:13:35.572
I will personally take charge
of the proceedings against him.

02:13:35.708 --> 02:13:39.667
I can't wait to be in court
to witness this execution.

02:14:01.792 --> 02:14:04.333
Lord Halifax, owner of L'Impartial,

02:14:04.708 --> 02:14:06.583
called to the bar today

02:14:06.750 --> 02:14:09.250
to answer the charges of defamation,

02:14:09.417 --> 02:14:11.667
had to leave the country in haste.

02:14:13.667 --> 02:14:16.000
But he commits
to having his representative

02:14:16.083 --> 02:14:18.375
before this court at 2 PM.

02:14:45.292 --> 02:14:47.834
Mr. Judge, the comedy
has gone on long enough.

02:14:47.917 --> 02:14:49.506
This is not the boulevards.

02:14:51.458 --> 02:14:55.708
I ask the representative
of Mr. Halifax to identify himself.

02:15:03.792 --> 02:15:06.458
What are you doing? It's not over yet.

02:15:23.583 --> 02:15:25.995
I am the representative of Lord Halifax.

02:15:29.833 --> 02:15:31.208
I stand before you

02:15:31.375 --> 02:15:35.208
because L'Impartial is accused
of spreading false news.

02:15:35.750 --> 02:15:37.458
But I assert here

02:15:37.708 --> 02:15:40.292
that the Danglars boats
have indeed disappeared.

02:15:40.375 --> 02:15:42.708
Nonsense, my fleet is in Marseille!

02:15:42.875 --> 02:15:44.000
This is a farce!

02:15:46.500 --> 02:15:48.584
- What proof do you have?
- You just need to

02:15:48.667 --> 02:15:51.500
contact the port authority of Marseille.

02:15:51.958 --> 02:15:55.250
So you persist in your claims?

02:15:55.917 --> 02:15:59.708
I persist and I sign, Your Honor.

02:16:00.500 --> 02:16:02.795
But I want to do it under my real name.

02:16:02.958 --> 02:16:04.458
You have a false one?

02:16:08.042 --> 02:16:11.000
I am known
by the name of Andrea Cavalcanti.

02:16:11.167 --> 02:16:14.708
After years on the streets,
I was taken in by a great

02:16:14.875 --> 02:16:17.750
and wealthy family
of the Italian aristocracy.

02:16:17.917 --> 02:16:19.667
I grew up as a thief

02:16:20.042 --> 02:16:21.667
and ended up a prince.

02:16:21.833 --> 02:16:26.208
It's not a more honest profession,
but much more pleasant.

02:16:29.208 --> 02:16:33.000
It is here, in Paris,
that I finally found my real father.

02:16:39.791 --> 02:16:42.416
I was born on November 3, 1815.

02:16:45.750 --> 02:16:46.750
In Auteuil.

02:16:53.041 --> 02:16:54.666
Mr. Judge, could...

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:59.875
the accused present evidence
for what he claims?

02:17:00.041 --> 02:17:02.666
I'm getting to that, Mr. Prosecutor.

02:17:02.833 --> 02:17:05.083
Your patience will be rewarded.

02:17:08.750 --> 02:17:12.791
I am the bastard of a French aristocrat
and his mistress!

02:17:17.125 --> 02:17:20.916
My mother does not know I am alive
because... my father

02:17:21.083 --> 02:17:23.583
told her that I died at birth.

02:17:25.125 --> 02:17:27.791
He wrapped me in cloth
and buried me alive.

02:17:30.250 --> 02:17:33.458
You speak, sir,
of an attempt at infanticide.

02:17:35.125 --> 02:17:37.067
That's what should have happened

02:17:37.583 --> 02:17:40.500
if my aunt had not dug me up.

02:17:40.666 --> 02:17:42.291
Who do you accuse?

02:17:43.291 --> 02:17:44.958
A respectable man...

02:17:45.583 --> 02:17:46.916
whom you all know.

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000
His coat of arms is on this cloth.

02:17:59.875 --> 02:18:01.000
My father...

02:18:01.458 --> 02:18:04.083
is none other than the man before me.

02:18:08.416 --> 02:18:10.000
Prosecutor Villefort.

02:18:15.583 --> 02:18:16.583
Silence!

02:18:16.916 --> 02:18:19.622
- Or I will have the room evacuated.
- Calumny!

02:18:20.208 --> 02:18:21.333
I will sue you!

02:18:21.791 --> 02:18:23.083
Mr. Cavalcanti,

02:18:24.500 --> 02:18:26.958
do you understand the seriousness
of your accusations?

02:18:27.041 --> 02:18:30.218
I will not settle for a cloth,
even stained with blood.

02:18:30.916 --> 02:18:34.291
Mr. Prosecutor will bring you
the proof of what I assert.

02:18:36.541 --> 02:18:38.541
- But you are delusional!
- Father.

02:18:39.500 --> 02:18:40.791
.

02:18:40.958 --> 02:18:43.253
Do not force my mother to come testify.

02:18:43.500 --> 02:18:45.618
She has, I believe, suffered enough.

02:18:56.916 --> 02:18:58.250
The trial is suspended

02:18:58.333 --> 02:19:01.208
for the duration of an inquiry.
Clear the room!

02:19:03.166 --> 02:19:04.250
And one.

02:19:06.625 --> 02:19:09.125
Come on, Victoria, let's go! Excuse me.

02:19:09.875 --> 02:19:11.041
Let us pass.

02:19:23.166 --> 02:19:25.250
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

02:19:26.333 --> 02:19:29.583
Your father wanted me as a son-in-law,
but...

02:19:30.583 --> 02:19:33.250
it cannot be, your mother is also mine.

02:19:36.375 --> 02:19:38.140
Do not forget your life lines.

02:19:38.666 --> 02:19:40.041
Be happy, my sister.

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:57.000
Count!

02:19:58.292 --> 02:19:59.292
Count!

02:20:00.958 --> 02:20:04.083
This story makes no sense.
We're swimming in madness.

02:20:04.250 --> 02:20:07.750
My boats were still in
Marseille yesterday. I...

02:20:07.917 --> 02:20:12.125
I will need a...
a delay to pay you back.

02:20:12.292 --> 02:20:14.208
If...

02:20:15.667 --> 02:20:17.458
You have nothing left, Baron.

02:20:18.042 --> 02:20:20.278
Everything that was yours is now mine.

02:20:21.042 --> 02:20:24.542
The only thing you have left
are these clothes.

02:20:26.083 --> 02:20:29.083
Leave Paris, and perhaps
I will not let your wife

02:20:29.250 --> 02:20:31.250
and your daughter starve.

02:20:31.417 --> 02:20:33.042
But, Count, I...

02:20:33.208 --> 02:20:35.625
Do you find me brutal, Baron?

02:20:38.708 --> 02:20:40.542
"Not only do I know it,

02:20:41.833 --> 02:20:43.245
but I take pride in it."

02:20:57.083 --> 02:20:59.542
You should escort your wife home.

02:21:00.042 --> 02:21:01.458
She looks quite pale.

02:21:10.458 --> 02:21:11.500
And two.

02:21:55.042 --> 02:21:56.042
Father!

02:22:09.250 --> 02:22:10.542
From Angèle.

02:22:35.292 --> 02:22:36.292
Get away!

02:22:36.792 --> 02:22:37.792
No!

02:22:55.542 --> 02:22:56.667
Why?

02:22:58.542 --> 02:22:59.542
Why?

02:23:09.792 --> 02:23:11.000
Don't cry.

02:24:30.167 --> 02:24:32.333
We knew it would end like this.

02:24:33.292 --> 02:24:34.292
We knew.

02:24:34.458 --> 02:24:35.458
Haydée!

02:24:40.125 --> 02:24:41.542
He disobeyed.

02:24:43.792 --> 02:24:45.250
Disobeyed?

02:24:50.167 --> 02:24:51.833
Disobeyed what?

02:24:54.792 --> 02:24:56.792
You taught him nothing but hatred.

02:24:57.375 --> 02:24:59.750
You put this dagger in his hand.

02:25:03.167 --> 02:25:05.500
It's your pain that speaks.

02:25:08.333 --> 02:25:09.792
I loved him like a son.

02:25:16.792 --> 02:25:18.375
Do you love me too?

02:25:22.500 --> 02:25:25.958
Do you also intend
to sacrifice me for your revenge?

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:28.792
This is not revenge.

02:25:30.167 --> 02:25:31.750
It's justice.

02:25:37.792 --> 02:25:40.875
Do not forget your tears, Haydée,
your mother's screams

02:25:40.958 --> 02:25:42.792
and your father's blood.

02:25:42.958 --> 02:25:45.429
And the name of the one who betrayed them.

02:25:45.583 --> 02:25:47.125
Do not forget his name!

02:26:18.583 --> 02:26:19.625
If you love me

02:26:19.792 --> 02:26:22.625
as I love you,
do not seek to see me again.

02:26:22.792 --> 02:26:25.334
You are too noble of heart
not to understand.

02:26:25.417 --> 02:26:29.006
I keep my strength to fight
against myself and drink my tears.

02:26:29.417 --> 02:26:32.583
Be happy far from me, you deserve it.

02:26:40.917 --> 02:26:41.958
Albert?

02:27:19.583 --> 02:27:20.583
Albert.

02:27:21.708 --> 02:27:22.958
You are crazy.

02:27:23.125 --> 02:27:24.500
You cannot stay.

02:27:24.667 --> 02:27:27.334
Haydée,
I have only known you for a short time...

02:27:27.417 --> 02:27:28.500
Leave.

02:27:29.125 --> 02:27:31.714
Flee from me like one
flees from the plague.

02:27:32.333 --> 02:27:35.216
- I will bring you misfortune.
- But flee with me.

02:27:35.750 --> 02:27:37.250
I swear to you, Haydée,

02:27:37.875 --> 02:27:41.250
instead of despair,
it is happiness that I promise you.

02:27:42.333 --> 02:27:45.917
You do not know me.
You do not know the Count.

02:27:46.083 --> 02:27:47.083
Haydée...

02:27:47.167 --> 02:27:49.050
If you love me as I love you...

02:27:52.292 --> 02:27:53.750
Say goodbye to me.

02:27:55.125 --> 02:27:56.333
I beg you.

02:27:59.667 --> 02:28:00.667
Say it!

02:28:06.292 --> 02:28:07.875
I will therefore tell you

02:28:09.542 --> 02:28:12.660
testifying to God,
who reads the depths of my heart...

02:28:15.250 --> 02:28:18.833
I wish you a happy life without my memory.

02:28:21.917 --> 02:28:23.167
Goodbye, my love.

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:26.000
This look.

02:28:30.083 --> 02:28:31.875
Without you, my life is lost.

02:28:32.458 --> 02:28:33.811
My misfortune, certain.

02:28:35.042 --> 02:28:36.292
What will you do?

02:28:37.917 --> 02:28:40.583
But rest assured, I will keep my promise.

02:28:41.292 --> 02:28:43.292
But please, will you live?

02:28:44.042 --> 02:28:45.333
What do you care?

02:28:47.750 --> 02:28:49.633
In your eyes, I am already dead.

02:28:58.333 --> 02:28:59.583
Let's flee.

02:29:12.792 --> 02:29:13.792
Haydée.

02:29:14.083 --> 02:29:16.667
If you wish to join the Morcerf family,

02:29:17.208 --> 02:29:18.792
Albert deserves to know

02:29:18.958 --> 02:29:20.083
your story.

02:29:21.500 --> 02:29:25.208
If you remain silent,
I will be forced to speak on your behalf.

02:29:27.167 --> 02:29:28.750
Must I really speak

02:29:28.917 --> 02:29:30.167
in your name?

02:29:30.625 --> 02:29:32.542
Count, please.

02:29:32.708 --> 02:29:34.238
Haydée is the daughter...

02:29:34.333 --> 02:29:35.542
Stop!

02:29:40.292 --> 02:29:41.625
I will speak.

02:30:00.167 --> 02:30:03.958
My father was an illustrious man
known as Ali Tebelin.

02:30:07.792 --> 02:30:09.083
Pasha of Janina.

02:30:16.625 --> 02:30:17.958
I was 10 years old

02:30:18.417 --> 02:30:21.182
when he was killed in front of
me and my mother.

02:30:22.208 --> 02:30:24.125
He had received a French soldier

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:26.883
who was supposed to be our ally.

02:30:28.625 --> 02:30:31.155
Even after being pieced
by a dozen bullets,

02:30:32.292 --> 02:30:33.125
my father

02:30:33.292 --> 02:30:35.792
still found the strength to attack

02:30:37.542 --> 02:30:39.917
the man who had sold him out

02:30:42.583 --> 02:30:44.407
by putting out one of his eyes.

02:30:47.125 --> 02:30:48.833
I never saw my mother again.

02:30:51.708 --> 02:30:53.792
That one-eyed officer sold me as a slave

02:30:53.875 --> 02:30:55.792
to a Vlach tribe in the Balkans.

02:30:57.042 --> 02:30:58.750
- His name was...
- That's enough.

02:30:58.833 --> 02:30:59.917
Albert.

02:31:05.250 --> 02:31:08.125
- You manipulated me.
- I warned you.

02:31:08.292 --> 02:31:11.542
- You used me.
- You might regret your words.

02:31:11.708 --> 02:31:14.750
- You think you can scare me?
- Don't provoke me.

02:31:14.917 --> 02:31:16.375
Albert, please.

02:31:16.542 --> 02:31:17.542
Count!

02:31:17.708 --> 02:31:21.826
You took everything from me.
Except my name, which you have tarnished.

02:31:22.708 --> 02:31:23.708
No!

02:31:24.292 --> 02:31:26.208
Oh, count, I beg you.

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.083
I take your glove as thrown.

02:31:29.250 --> 02:31:32.133
I will return it
wrapped around a bullet tomorrow.

02:31:40.458 --> 02:31:42.083
You have no mercy?

02:31:42.250 --> 02:31:44.625
Did they show any for Edmond Dantès?

02:31:45.958 --> 02:31:47.042
Look at me.

02:31:47.208 --> 02:31:51.458
I am nothing but the ars
of a deaf and blind fate.

02:31:56.417 --> 02:31:59.542
Fernand de Morcerf will know
what my father knew.

02:32:02.542 --> 02:32:04.292
If you kill Albert,

02:32:05.125 --> 02:32:09.750
you will no longer be able to say:
"God is with me, for me."

02:32:11.917 --> 02:32:13.583
You will be a murderer.

02:32:17.417 --> 02:32:21.250
The Bible says that the sons will pay
for their fathers' crimes.

02:32:28.500 --> 02:32:30.333
Jacopo, follow her.

02:33:10.958 --> 02:33:12.417
Leave us, Jacopo.

02:33:14.583 --> 02:33:15.708
Madam.

02:33:16.458 --> 02:33:17.875
What are you doing here?

02:33:18.708 --> 02:33:20.708
Edmond, you will not kill my son.

02:33:22.167 --> 02:33:23.708
What name did you utter?

02:33:24.333 --> 02:33:25.333
Yours.

02:33:26.875 --> 02:33:28.334
It's not Madame de Morcerf

02:33:28.417 --> 02:33:30.459
who stands before you; it's Mercédès.

02:33:30.542 --> 02:33:32.542
I don't know anyone by that name.

02:33:35.333 --> 02:33:37.628
I recognized you as soon as I saw you.

02:33:38.417 --> 02:33:40.959
And even without seeing you,
I would have recognized your voice.

02:33:41.042 --> 02:33:45.125
My mind struggled, but my heart knew. Since
then, I've been following you, watching you,

02:33:45.208 --> 02:33:47.125
I seek what you want at Morcerf.

02:33:47.292 --> 02:33:49.625
Fernand, you mean, madam.

02:33:50.250 --> 02:33:52.750
Since we are recalling our first names.

02:33:55.917 --> 02:33:57.292
The guilty one is me.

02:33:59.292 --> 02:34:02.528
It is I who lacked strength
in the face of your absence.

02:34:03.167 --> 02:34:05.792
It is I who lacked faith in your death.

02:34:05.958 --> 02:34:09.625
- Me!
- Why? Why were you alone?

02:34:10.500 --> 02:34:13.250
Why was I absent?
Why was I arrested?

02:34:13.833 --> 02:34:16.167
Why was I declared dead?

02:34:16.333 --> 02:34:17.708
I don't know.

02:34:21.583 --> 02:34:24.625
I imagine he no longer writes you
love letters,

02:34:24.792 --> 02:34:27.500
but you will easily recognize
his handwriting.

02:34:30.667 --> 02:34:31.667
Here.

02:34:32.792 --> 02:34:34.417
Look, Mercédès.

02:34:36.667 --> 02:34:38.542
Here is what your husband wrote

02:34:38.708 --> 02:34:40.667
to Villefort twenty years ago.

02:34:44.375 --> 02:34:48.375
I must take my revenge, Mercédès.
It is necessary.

02:34:50.958 --> 02:34:52.841
Then take your revenge, Edmond.

02:34:55.500 --> 02:34:57.333
But on the guilty ones.

02:34:58.958 --> 02:35:04.017
Revenge yourself on Fernand who betrayed you,
revenge yourself on me, but spare Albert.

02:35:07.750 --> 02:35:10.000
If you knew all the prayers...

02:35:13.458 --> 02:35:16.042
If you knew all the tears I have shed...

02:35:16.542 --> 02:35:19.167
Did you lose your father in solitude?

02:35:19.333 --> 02:35:23.125
Did you see the one you loved
in the arms of your rival?

02:35:24.500 --> 02:35:27.333
- Did you see all of that?
- No.

02:35:28.500 --> 02:35:29.500
Yes.

02:35:31.042 --> 02:35:33.984
But I see the man
whom I have never stopped loving

02:35:34.208 --> 02:35:36.503
ready to become the murderer of my son.

02:35:51.250 --> 02:35:52.500
What do you want?

02:35:56.042 --> 02:35:57.958
Do you want your son to live?

02:35:59.250 --> 02:36:00.333
He will live.

02:36:04.333 --> 02:36:05.375
Thank you.

02:36:07.125 --> 02:36:08.417
Thank you, Edmond.

02:36:14.083 --> 02:36:15.667
I find you again.

02:36:17.500 --> 02:36:21.792
As I have always dreamed of you,
as I have always loved you.

02:36:39.417 --> 02:36:41.208
We must say goodbye.

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:44.000
Goodbye?

02:36:46.833 --> 02:36:49.657
If I renounce taking
justice into my own hands,

02:36:49.792 --> 02:36:52.167
I renounce what keeps me alive.

02:36:55.917 --> 02:36:57.917
The duel will take place tomorrow.

02:37:00.500 --> 02:37:01.875
Goodbye, Mercédès.

02:37:13.500 --> 02:37:15.250
Mister Albert de Morcerf,

02:37:15.583 --> 02:37:18.833
you have publicly challenged
the Count of Monte Cristo.

02:37:19.458 --> 02:37:22.694
The duel will take place at twenty paces,
at my command.

02:37:23.375 --> 02:37:24.875
Priority to the offended.

02:37:30.500 --> 02:37:31.583
Ready.

02:37:34.292 --> 02:37:35.417
Go, gentlemen.

02:37:58.375 --> 02:37:59.375
Fire!

02:38:26.375 --> 02:38:27.375
Fire!

02:39:11.500 --> 02:39:15.167
I believe I see in your eyes
a glimmer of disappointment.

02:39:17.125 --> 02:39:20.750
I will never forgive you
for taking his life

02:39:21.792 --> 02:39:23.498
and for tearing my heart out.

02:39:26.125 --> 02:39:27.542
So you loved him.

02:39:28.792 --> 02:39:30.125
Did I love him?

02:39:32.083 --> 02:39:36.042
Everything urged me to hate him,
but who knows why one falls in love?

02:39:36.125 --> 02:39:39.833
You can try to reason with yourself,
but it's too late.

02:39:40.250 --> 02:39:41.839
You have lost your balance.

02:39:44.583 --> 02:39:48.042
Your secret voice whispers to you
that there is no more chance.

02:39:48.125 --> 02:39:52.302
But instead of listening to that voice,
it was yours that I listened to.

02:39:54.208 --> 02:39:56.856
I have brought about
his misfortune and mine!

02:39:58.958 --> 02:40:02.667
What will I do with this love
that I did not give him?

02:40:04.292 --> 02:40:07.042
With these words that
I did not say to him?

02:40:09.333 --> 02:40:11.208
You said them to him.

02:40:13.625 --> 02:40:14.917
And he heard them.

02:40:22.500 --> 02:40:23.583
Albert...

02:40:39.208 --> 02:40:40.458
Count!

02:40:47.875 --> 02:40:49.375
Run away, now.

02:40:50.083 --> 02:40:53.083
Run away and do not let anyone
steal your happiness.

02:41:32.792 --> 02:41:33.792
Edmond!

02:41:40.042 --> 02:41:41.042
Edmond!

02:41:46.667 --> 02:41:48.542
Edmond, show yourself!

02:41:54.333 --> 02:41:55.708
I was waiting for you.

02:41:56.833 --> 02:41:58.875
You finally show your true face.

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:02.292
I sought to know yours.

02:42:03.542 --> 02:42:04.875
To know who you were.

02:42:06.625 --> 02:42:08.167
So I followed your traces.

02:42:09.042 --> 02:42:10.958
I went everywhere you went.

02:42:12.875 --> 02:42:14.583
I met them all:

02:42:15.417 --> 02:42:18.792
your friends, your comrades-in-arms,
your enemies, all...

02:42:20.167 --> 02:42:21.583
Who did you not betray?

02:42:23.083 --> 02:42:25.142
To whom have you remained faithful?

02:42:25.542 --> 02:42:27.833
Everywhere, you showed your true face.

02:42:28.875 --> 02:42:29.625
I have lost

02:42:29.792 --> 02:42:31.208
faith in Man,

02:42:31.583 --> 02:42:33.333
the day you betrayed me.

02:42:35.458 --> 02:42:37.047
You should have killed me.

02:42:37.167 --> 02:42:38.625
It's never too late.

02:46:38.500 --> 02:46:39.792
Get up.

02:47:00.583 --> 02:47:01.833
Look at me.

02:47:02.583 --> 02:47:03.708
Look at me!

02:47:07.125 --> 02:47:08.125
Kill me.

02:47:10.875 --> 02:47:13.111
We always find greatness in the dead.

02:47:14.167 --> 02:47:15.875
In the end, we forgive them.

02:47:21.833 --> 02:47:23.892
I don't want anyone to forgive you.

02:48:36.375 --> 02:48:39.667
Mercédès, I came to say goodbye

02:48:39.833 --> 02:48:41.875
where life tore us apart,

02:48:42.042 --> 02:48:43.667
twenty-one years ago today.

02:48:44.333 --> 02:48:48.000
So much has broken within me
and around me since then,

02:48:48.167 --> 02:48:50.208
that the man you knew is no more.

02:48:50.792 --> 02:48:53.083
I promised to love you until my death

02:48:53.250 --> 02:48:54.917
and long after,

02:48:55.417 --> 02:48:57.125
and I will always love you,

02:48:57.292 --> 02:49:00.469
but it is no longer in my power
to bring you happiness.

02:49:00.958 --> 02:49:03.500
I can only offer you consolation now.

02:49:04.458 --> 02:49:06.292
Your son will be happy.

02:49:06.708 --> 02:49:10.417
Albert and Haydée will live the story
that we could not live.

02:49:10.583 --> 02:49:12.250
Happiness to our children

02:49:12.625 --> 02:49:15.917
who will survive us
and taste the sweetness of love.

02:49:17.417 --> 02:49:20.359
As I write to you,
I live my last moments with you.

02:49:20.792 --> 02:49:23.833
Everything after will be just memories.

02:49:24.458 --> 02:49:26.917
I will carry them with me across the sea,

02:49:27.500 --> 02:49:30.209
the only place on earth
where everything is horizon

02:49:30.292 --> 02:49:33.083
and where there are no traces left by men.

02:49:34.333 --> 02:49:36.625
Live and be happy.

02:49:37.333 --> 02:49:38.417
Never forget,

02:49:38.583 --> 02:49:42.000
until the day when providence
may reunite us again,

02:49:42.167 --> 02:49:45.285
that all human wisdom
is contained in these two words:

02:49:45.667 --> 02:49:46.917
wait

02:49:47.083 --> 02:49:48.417
and hope.

02:49:50.625 --> 02:49:52.125
Edmond Dantès,

02:49:52.292 --> 02:49:54.500
Count of Monte Cristo.
