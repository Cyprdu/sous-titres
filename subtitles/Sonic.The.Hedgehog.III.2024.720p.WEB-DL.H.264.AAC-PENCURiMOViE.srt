2
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,520
Oh, yes.

3
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,760
You got donuts.

4
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,220
I already ate all the Boston cream.

5
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,700
Kyle?

6
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:21,850
This place gives me the creeps.

7
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:23,690
Relax.

8
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,590
That popsicle hasn't moved in 50 years.

9
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,980
Someone's hacking the system.

10
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:05,520
What?

11
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,400
The containment tank is destabilizing.

12
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,400
He's waking up.

13
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,870
We need more guys.

14
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,940
That is all the guys.

15
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,760
I thought we were going tubing.

16
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,020
Hold on, hold on.

17
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,400
Is this a race?

18
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,920
You're going down.

19
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:37,360
It is my destiny to claim the throne of
family champion, Hedgehog.

20
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,840
Haha, cute.

21
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,880
Are you sure you want to challenge the
fastest creature in the universe?

22
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,640
I mean, that's kind of my whole brand.

23
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,460
Okay, Tom and Maddie, count us down.

24
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:47,800
Right.

25
00:04:48,645 --> 00:04:49,736
Don't worry, little sibling, right?

26
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,360
We're really healthy.

27
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,261
Me and my brothers used to do this kind of
thing all the time.

28
00:04:52,285 --> 00:04:54,980
Tom, your brothers are lunatics,
and neither of them were born with the

29
00:04:54,981 --> 00:04:56,960
power to trigger a global cataclysmic
event.

30
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,400
That's a fair point.

31
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,080
You hear that, boys?

32
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,800
No cataclysmic events, okay?

33
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,280
Let's keep this cataclysmic list.

34
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,120
Understood, Lord of the Donuts.

35
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,280
Then on your marks, get set, go!

36
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:14,300
And away out in front, to the surprise of
absolutely no one, it's the blue blur,

37
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:18,360
the red shoe rocket, the one,
the only... Come on, Sonic!

38
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,320
Good job!

39
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,800
Yeah!

40
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,680
Wait, in the what now?

41
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,740
I am also defeating you, Hedgehog.

42
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:25,460
Seriously?

43
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,880
Alright, you know what?

44
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,600
Time to light the afterburners.

45
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,320
It's a bird!

46
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,620
It's a plane!

47
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,280
It's Air Hedgehog!

48
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,240
Lost?

49
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,520
How is that even possible?

50
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:55,521
I do not lose!

51
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,900
I am also defeating you, Hedgehog.

52
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,600
Okay, okay, I get it, man.

53
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,796
I don't need to rub it in.

54
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,060
Come on, Sonic!

55
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,200
Catch up!

56
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,440
Yeah!

57
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,240
Wait, what's going on?

58
00:06:07,305 --> 00:06:12,180
Why are you guys acting like... holograms?

59
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,260
Which means I remain the undefeated speed
champion of all time!

60
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,000
Yes!

61
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,380
And the crowd goes wild!

62
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,860
But also, what's going on?

63
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
Surprise!

64
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,780
Wait a second, you guys, what is all this?

65
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,940
Happy Be-Arthur Day?

66
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:36,240
Oh, it's Happy Be-Earth Day.

67
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:39,020
Today is the anniversary of the day you
came to Earth, bud.

68
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,461
It's your Earth Day birthday.

69
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:44,420
So the race was just a distraction, which
I totally didn't fall for, by the way.

70
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,240
Good try, though.

71
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,320
So you could throw a party for me?

72
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,900
Today we honor you, Hedgehog.

73
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,140
If it wasn't for you, none of us would be
here right now.

74
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,420
You boys are right, bud.

75
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,316
You know, the day you came to this planet
is the day all our lives changed forever.

76
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,340
And we became a family.

77
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:04,420
You guys, I don't know what to say.

78
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,081
Except... Let's party!

79
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,960
It's now on till the break of dawn!

80
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,960
Thanks for the surprise party.

81
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,631
It really means a lot to me.

82
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,860
Yeah, you deserve it, pal.

83
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
No way!

84
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,261
Is that... What?

85
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:29,971
Dude, can you just for once walk at my
speed?

86
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:36,700
Whoa.

87
00:07:36,701 --> 00:07:37,701
Sonic.

88
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,260
This is your... Yep.

89
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,960
My old cave.

90
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:41,720
Oh, man.

91
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,601
I can't believe this is where you lived
all those years.

92
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:45,320
Hey!

93
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,640
My state-of-the-art security system!

94
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,430
Still works.

95
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,380
Hey, bud.

96
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,760
What's this?

97
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,220
Wow.

98
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,080
You know, I drew that on my first night on
Earth.

99
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,760
I wanted to remember where I came from.

100
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,640
I still miss her.

101
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,980
You think Longclaw would be proud of me?

102
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,220
I know she would, pal.

103
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,065
Because even though
you lost her at such a young

104
00:08:18,066 --> 00:08:21,181
age, you didn't let your
pain change who you are.

105
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,400
In here.

106
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Yeah.

107
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,060
In my lungs.

108
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,680
Or your heart.

109
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,440
Heart, right.

110
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,360
Yeah, makes more sense.

111
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:31,820
Not lungs.

112
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,060
Heart.

113
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,776
That's the thing about life, Sonic.

114
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,560
It's all about the choices we make.

115
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,841
You're gonna make some good ones, and
knowing you, you're gonna make some bad ones.

116
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,440
But...

117
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,994
As long as you remember
to listen to your heart, you're

118
00:08:46,069 --> 00:08:48,235
gonna make the right choice
when it matters the most.

119
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,920
Thanks.

120
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,780
I don't know what I'd do without you.

121
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,920
I'd probably be a totally different
hedgehog.

122
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,960
2024?

123
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,560
I've been trapped for fifty years?

124
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:29,710
Why won't you leave me alone?

125
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,110
Take him down!

126
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,220
I have dishonored my marshmallow.

127
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,760
It's really just a question of temperature
and distance.

128
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,540
It's not a competition.

129
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,220
This is so nice.

130
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,940
Peace.

131
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:49,440
Quiet.

132
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,100
Finally.

133
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,820
Finally.

134
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,900
What did we

135
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:20,790
do?

136
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,130
Or what did they do?

137
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,190
What did you do?

138
00:10:23,191 --> 00:10:23,930
I don't know.

139
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,350
I do a lot of stuff.

140
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,380
Mr. and Mrs. Zulkowski?

141
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,280
Aliens.

142
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,540
Aliens?

143
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,260
Excuse me?

144
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,836
Is that like we're from different planet?

145
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,500
Oh, yeah, we are.

146
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,720
I guess we are aliens.

147
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:41,740
Please continue.

148
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,080
I'm Director Rockwell.

149
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,740
There is a very dangerous situation
unfolding right now in Tokyo.

150
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,380
Commander Walters is requesting Team
Sonic's immediate assistance.

151
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,560
Team Sonic?

152
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,940
Who picked that name?

153
00:10:53,941 --> 00:10:54,720
Love it.

154
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,600
Ten out of ten.

155
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,920
No notes.

156
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,140
Tom and Matty, put the s'mores on ice.

157
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,700
Because Team Sonic is off to save the day.

158
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,420
We're back.

159
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,980
Good evening and welcome to Tails Air
Flight 1012.

160
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,940
We're looking at an on-time arrival into
Tokyo.

161
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,100
Okay, Captain.

162
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,620
We got a rogue alien on the loose.

163
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,840
How do we find him?

164
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,320
Start with the giant fireball?

165
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,460
I love it.

166
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,120
Let's start with the giant fireball.

167
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,180
Finally, some action.

168
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,140
Okay.

169
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,600
Time to gear up.

170
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,260
Titanium handcuffs.

171
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,140
Completely indestructible.

172
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,460
I don't need your silly gizmos,
Fox.

173
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,760
And you know why?

174
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,500
Because I am one million percent muscle.

175
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:02,600
Yes, good.

176
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,960
You've been listening.

177
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,780
We're over the drop, sir.

178
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:06,600
All right, here we go.

179
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:07,640
Showtime.

180
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:15,180
Now look, we don't know if it's Godzilla
or Hello Kitty down there, but as long as

181
00:12:15,181 --> 00:12:17,960
we stick together, there is nothing we
can't handle.

182
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,600
Team Sonic on three.

183
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,900
One, two, three.

184
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,320
Team Sonic!

185
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,120
Talk about low-budget flights.

186
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,620
No food or movies?

187
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
We're out of here.

188
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,880
What happened here?

189
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,680
Looks like Gun got their butts kicked.

190
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,220
Keep your eyes open.

191
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,460
Tails, anything?

192
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,120
Whoa, these energy readings are off the
charts.

193
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,600
Look out!

194
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,500
One million percent.

195
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,590
Are you guys seeing this?

196
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,470
He looks just like you.

197
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:32,150
Impossible.

198
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,730
You're a colorful bunch.

199
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,670
Um, excuse me.

200
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,470
Why do you look like me?

201
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,170
I don't look like you.

202
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:40,630
You look like me.

203
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,330
Why do you look like me?

204
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:43,350
Hey, you know what?

205
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:45,850
I'll ask the questions, new hedgehog.

206
00:13:45,851 --> 00:13:47,390
Who are you?

207
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,410
Why do you look like me?

208
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,090
This is a waste of time.

209
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:53,190
Walk away before you get hurt.

210
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,970
Whoa, whoa, easy, buddy.

211
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:57,670
We don't want to fight you.

212
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:00,050
Actually, Sonic, I would like to fight.

213
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:01,990
Not now.

214
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:06,030
Why don't you stop throwing cars at us for
a second and come down here to talk?

215
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,450
You jumped out of a gun helicopter.

216
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,730
There's nothing to talk about.

217
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,350
All right, then.

218
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:12,830
Enough!

219
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:13,830
Knuckles, no!

220
00:14:13,831 --> 00:14:16,990
Let us talk without fists!

221
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,050
Knuckles!

222
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,130
Knuckles, Knuckles, are you okay?

223
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:36,590
No, not really.

224
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,730
Who is this guy?

225
00:14:40,731 --> 00:14:44,070
He is much more impressive than the
hedgehog I fought previously.

226
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,230
Dude, I'm standing right here.

227
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:49,190
Now come on, you can't take us all at
once.

228
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:57,010
Okay,

229
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,030
he took us all at once.

230
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,910
Weakling.

231
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,220
Don't try to follow me.

232
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,920
Sonic, I know that look.

233
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,100
Going after him is a bad idea.

234
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,000
When has that ever stopped me?

235
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,180
I gotta ask, wanna hedgehog to another?

236
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,680
Who does your highlights?

237
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,380
Hey, dangerously weaving through traffic
is my thing.

238
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,380
Coming through!

239
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,880
Why are you running away?

240
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,400
We were just getting started.

241
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:59,000
The more you talk, the harder I wanna hit
you.

242
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,500
Watch out!

243
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,920
I'm gonna throw up.

244
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,320
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

245
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:29,540
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

246
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:56,070
1.21 gigawatts.

247
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,630
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

248
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:04,070
Sonic, are you okay?

249
00:17:04,071 --> 00:17:05,410
I'm fine, guys.

250
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:07,779
And before you ask, I
handcuff myself for tactical

251
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,431
reasons that I do not
have time to explain.

252
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,190
You shouldn't have gone off on your own.

253
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,750
We're supposed to be a team.

254
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:14,790
Sorry, buddy.

255
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,651
I'm still working on this teamwork thing.

256
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,310
So now what?

257
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:22,410
Well, I'm not jumping out of any more
helicopters until we get some answers from Gun.

258
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,270
We need somewhere to regroup.

259
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,670
I know just the place.

260
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:39,230
One, two, three.

261
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:39,850
Whoa!

262
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:41,470
It's an ambush.

263
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:43,630
You'll never take us alive, foul beast.

264
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:44,930
Calm down, Knuckles.

265
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:49,290
This is a chow garden, one of the top 10
must-see spots in all of Tokyo.

266
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,470
It's a perfect place for us to blend in.

267
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,430
Are you Detective Pikachu?

268
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,110
Yes, he is.

269
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,610
He does look like a Pokemon.

270
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,450
Pika pika.

271
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:00,650
Commander Walters.

272
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:04,450
Sonic, thank God you're all okay.

273
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:06,050
I'm sure you have questions.

274
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:08,790
Just a big ticked off red and black one?

275
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:10,330
Who was that guy?

276
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,970
Shadow's story began a lot like your
Sonic.

277
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:16,321
But where you found
family and friends on

278
00:18:16,322 --> 00:18:20,331
this planet, Shadow
found only pain and loss.

279
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:26,030
It begins over 50 years ago with a meteor
crash in a quiet corner of Oklahoma.

280
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:30,210
The meteorite contained a life form.

281
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:34,490
The ultimate life form.

282
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:42,050
Shadow's power, his chaos energy,
went far beyond any living creature.

283
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:47,198
The scientists who
discovered and believed this

284
00:18:47,199 --> 00:18:50,111
power would usher in
a new era for humanity.

285
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:53,710
But Shadow's power proved too dangerous.

286
00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:01,410
A terrible accident destroyed the lab,
taking human lives with it.

287
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:05,250
The project leader was blamed for the
incident and imprisoned.

288
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:11,310
With the program cancelled, Shadow was a
loose end no one knew how to deal with.

289
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:16,230
Too dangerous to be walking free,
too valuable to destroy.

290
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,770
So I had him placed into stasis.

291
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,470
Indefinitely.

292
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:31,250
Wait a second, if Shadow's been on ice for
50 years, someone had to help him escape.

293
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:35,770
True, but there's only a few people in the
world who even know of Shadow's existence.

294
00:19:47,510 --> 00:20:19,660
Egg Drones?

295
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,640
But Robotnik is supposed to be dead.

296
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,760
Konnichiwa?

297
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,700
I'm sorry, we already had our big
motorcycle chase for the evening?

298
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,200
Commander Walters!

299
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,520
Commander Walters, are you okay?

300
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,550
Sonic, take this.

301
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:15,850
What is it?

302
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:20,470
A key to the most powerful weapon Gunt has
ever built.

303
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:23,410
You're the only one I trust to keep it
safe.

304
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,510
Commander Walters.

305
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,320
Medevac is on route.

306
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,680
This launch key is missing.

307
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,410
I knew they couldn't be trusted.

308
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:05,310
Why are we running from Gunt?

309
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:07,030
Aren't we on the same team?

310
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:10,150
Until we get more information,
we're not trusting anyone.

311
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:11,490
Follow me.

312
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,060
Hold it right there, Tokyo Drift.

313
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,760
Who are you?

314
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,960
It's the goat milker!

315
00:22:38,515 --> 00:22:39,740
It's the goat milker!

316
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,140
Relax.

317
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,540
I'm not here to fight.

318
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,260
Then why are you here?

319
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,960
And why did you free Shadow?

320
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,360
Are you kidding?

321
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,720
The last thing we want is more super
-powered hedgehogs running around.

322
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,580
The doctor had nothing to do with it.

323
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,360
And I can prove it.

324
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:12,850
Please.

325
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:14,850
Join me in the crowd.

326
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:19,050
And now back to the last mission.

327
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:21,410
I have fallen in love with another.

328
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:24,650
But who, Gabriela?

329
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:26,010
Tell me.

330
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:30,430
My twin brother, Pablo?

331
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,250
Bastard!

332
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:37,570
Buenos dias.

333
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:39,470
Hermano!

334
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,790
Let that be a lesson to you, Juan.

335
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:52,070
Family is a field of emotional claymores
that leave you abandoned, betrayed...

336
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:58,650
and weeping while you eat cake,
which creates copious amounts of adipose

337
00:23:58,651 --> 00:24:02,150
tissue and what some calloused individuals
refer to as...

338
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:04,790
man boobs.

339
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:25,780
We have visitors.

340
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,480
Really?

341
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,840
I thought I was having an anthropomorphic
nightmare.

342
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:35,750
We're the only person I could trust in the
world showing up with all my worst enemies

343
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:39,240
while I was in a bathroom, playing congas
on my big fat belly.

344
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,620
Sorry, sir.

345
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:42,090
I don't believe it.

346
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,340
Eggman's alive.

347
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,800
And he's never looked worse.

348
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:52,080
Well, maybe this is what not giving a damn
what you think I look like looks like.

349
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,400
Sir, right now we have an even bigger
problem.

350
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,000
Oh, come on.

351
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,440
There's an imposter out there using your
technology.

352
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:02,720
Imposter?

353
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,540
That's impassa-what?

354
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:10,180
No, my sweet mechanized spawn.

355
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:15,348
Whomever this party-pooping
posse is looking for has

356
00:25:15,349 --> 00:25:19,740
stolen my persona and the
precious babies from my egg sack.

357
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:26,460
Well, I'll soon egg-sacked my revenge.

358
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,080
You see what I did there?

359
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:35,060
It's time for the dramatic soap opera
twist where this pablo reveals his won.

360
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:42,720
I cross-referencing the ciced coordinates
of each girl's energy spikes.

361
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:50,940
I can track my babies to the imposter's
base of operations right about there.

362
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:55,160
Sonic, I hate to say it, but I think we're
both after the same person.

363
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,000
Hold on, hold on.

364
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,920
You're not suggesting we team up with Dr.
Robot Stink, are you?

365
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,540
Perhaps the fox is right.

366
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,160
It could be our only chance to find this
mysterious, more impressive hedgehog.

367
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,080
Ugh.

368
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,520
All right, Egghead.

369
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:11,440
I hate to say it, but it looks like we're
partners.

370
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,160
On one condition.

371
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:18,300
Dude, you have serious issues.

372
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,220
What?

373
00:26:22,221 --> 00:26:23,221
Where are you?

374
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,580
What?

375
00:26:25,205 --> 00:26:26,280
Do this!

376
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:58,420
Tinker Taylor, I need room.

377
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,080
Think Elvis circa 1976.

378
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,520
Sir, I don't have the proper materials.

379
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,880
Found some.

380
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,960
Resourceful.

381
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,380
Hey!

382
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,920
This is a restricted area.

383
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:52,400
That's okay.

384
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,000
She's the professor's granddaughter.

385
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,660
He takes her everywhere.

386
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,020
Welcome to the lab, Maria.

387
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,640
I'm Captain Walters.

388
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,416
Oh, do you know where my room is?

389
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,920
Yeah, down the hall and to the right.

390
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,160
Make yourself at home.

391
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,940
But, um, let's lose the skates.

392
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:07,740
Okay, kiddo?

393
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,260
Okay.

394
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,200
Let's go.

395
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,040
Whoa!

396
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,740
Whoa!

397
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,400
Whoa!

398
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:13,810
Look at all those stars.

399
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:16,870
They're like diamonds.

400
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:24,230
My grandfather says it can take hundreds
of years for the light of a star to reach

401
00:31:24,231 --> 00:31:29,330
Earth, and by the time we see it,
the star might not even exist anymore.

402
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,300
Isn't that crazy?

403
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:38,090
A light shines even though the star is
gone.

404
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:40,970
Yeah, it does.

405
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:44,930
I wonder which one you came from,
Shadow.

406
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:46,230
I don't know.

407
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,130
I don't know anything about my home.

408
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:51,770
This is your home, Shadow.

409
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:53,810
Earth.

410
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:05,600
Maria, do you think I'm dangerous?

411
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,740
What are you talking about?

412
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:13,580
The way the scientists look at me,
I can tell they're afraid.

413
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:17,360
Like I'm the horrible thing from that
movie we watched.

414
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:21,840
I don't know what I am.

415
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:32,800
You're my friend, and you can do or be
anything you want.

416
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,100
Not because of your powers, but because of
who you are in here.

417
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,740
I don't know what I'd do without you.

418
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:06,180
I knew my father was the one that killed
one of the bad guys.

419
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,796
I worked as a branding expert,
always in my team.

420
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,700
I was in the competition for one of his
battles.

421
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:18,180
One of them was a sniper and I've never
truly known who he was before.

422
00:33:18,181 --> 00:33:19,600
So good luck to him.

423
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:28,750
Professor, it's good to see you,
Shadow.

424
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:31,530
I knew you'd come home.

425
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,450
I can't get her out of my head.

426
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:36,210
The pain.

427
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:37,630
It's too much.

428
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:40,870
And that is why we have to punish them.

429
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,690
Okay, I don't like you and you don't like
me.

430
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:49,090
Let's get this over with quickly.

431
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:51,410
Out of my way, dorkupine.

432
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:52,330
Dorkupine?

433
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:53,490
Really clever.

434
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:03,410
This door is six inch thick solid steel on
a pressurized latch.

435
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:05,918
I'll need a moment to
calculate the molecular

436
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,391
density and invert
the venting mechanics.

437
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:12,570
I unlocked him.

438
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:14,090
Subtle as always.

439
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,550
Fist for brains.

440
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:18,510
Easy, Shadow.

441
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:20,910
Those are the guests I've been expecting.

442
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:23,630
Let's give them a warm welcome.

443
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,650
What is this place?

444
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:34,330
Looks like a military base, but nobody's
been here for years.

445
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:36,010
I wonder if it's haunted.

446
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:36,670
Haunted?

447
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:39,190
Nobody said anything about being haunted.

448
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:40,850
What's the matter?

449
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:41,950
You afraid of ghosts?

450
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,630
Nothing scares an echidna warrior.

451
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:45,430
Uh, yeah.

452
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:47,411
Do you remember what happened last movie
night?

453
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:54,210
There's no such thing as a friendly ghost.

454
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,550
So, which way do we go?

455
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,550
I know.

456
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,150
We should split up.

457
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:04,910
Everyone with hideous, brightly colored
fur take the left and the middle.

458
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,350
Stone and I will go right.

459
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:07,290
No, no, no, no.

460
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:08,750
I'm not letting you out of my sight.

461
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:10,510
Tails, you and Stone go left.

462
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:11,890
Knuckles, you take the middle.

463
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,670
Eggman, you and me go right.

464
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:15,170
By all means.

465
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,630
We could use some time together to work on
your trust issues.

466
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:19,830
You know what?

467
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:20,510
You're right.

468
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,090
I should be more trusting.

469
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:24,710
I mean, you've only tried to kill me
twice.

470
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,950
Just a dark, creepy hallway.

471
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:30,710
Nothing to be afraid of.

472
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:33,890
You hear that, ghosts?

473
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,190
You don't frighten me.

474
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,730
Get a grip.

475
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,470
I'm just gonna come right out and say
this.

476
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:52,410
You're adorable.

477
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:54,290
Thanks.

478
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:56,710
So, what's it like being Sonic's
assistant?

479
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:59,010
Do you have a daily routine?

480
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:00,690
Paid time off?

481
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:01,010
Benefits?

482
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:03,270
Oh, I'm not Sonic's assistant.

483
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,630
We're teammates.

484
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:08,090
He's the leader, Knuckles is the muscle,
and I'm the gadget guy.

485
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:09,810
We all have a role to play.

486
00:36:10,155 --> 00:36:11,675
That's what makes the team so special.

487
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,630
That and the fact we're best friends.

488
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:15,590
You are?

489
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,640
Well, yeah, just like you and Eggman,
right?

490
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,330
Of course, yes.

491
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,230
Me and the doctor.

492
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:26,950
Best of friends.

493
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,310
It's definitely what we are.

494
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,230
Wow.

495
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,130
Look at all this stuff.

496
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:01,850
This was more than just a military base or
lab.

497
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:04,090
It was a home.

498
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,630
People lived here.

499
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:07,850
He had a family.

500
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:09,990
Is that what I smell?

501
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,950
The stench of domestic harmony?

502
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:17,190
You ever wonder what your life would have
been like if you had a family?

503
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:19,050
Hmm, no.

504
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:21,350
Maybe you wouldn't have gone full
supervillain.

505
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:24,110
I have no parents, no aunts, no uncles.

506
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:26,830
And something about my attitude renders
me...

507
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:31,690
...undesirable to all possible genders.

508
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,670
My future is a cul-de-sac.

509
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,670
The robot nickname ends...

510
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:41,990
...avec moi.

511
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:44,490
Yes, I know French.

512
00:37:50,915 --> 00:37:52,570
Is this where you grew up, Shadow?

513
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,170
No wonder you're so mad.

514
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,510
This place could really use a beanbag
chair and some comic books.

515
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,350
What happened here?

516
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,850
I'm tired of giving you warnings.

517
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:11,890
Where'd you go, hedgehog?

518
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,750
I wasn't finished trauma-dumping.

519
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:18,570
My darlings.

520
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:23,170
My eggy-weggings.

521
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:34,090
Memories... ...lie the
corners of my mind.

522
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:43,090
Misty watercolor memories...

523
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,090
...of the way...

524
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:50,499
...we were.

525
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:57,870
Don't believe it, don't you?

526
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:58,890
It's impossible.

527
00:38:59,050 --> 00:38:59,290
Is it?

528
00:38:59,470 --> 00:38:59,990
It couldn't be.

529
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:01,410
Are you?

530
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,630
Imposter!

531
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:04,690
You stole my babies.

532
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:07,790
They know who their real daddy is.

533
00:39:07,791 --> 00:39:09,290
Drone-napper?

534
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,850
Magnificent creations, my boy.

535
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:19,010
I borrowed them to lure you here and
reunite our family.

536
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,160
Is he I owe?

537
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:30,110
I'm your grandfather, Gerald Robotnik.

538
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,860
My grandfather?

539
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,880
But how?

540
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,760
And why?

541
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,960
And who did what with whom?

542
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:48,980
You hail from an ancestry of excellence.

543
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,680
Tied directly a moi.

544
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,100
Yes, I know French.

545
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:02,300
You do look like me, but fatter and older.

546
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:04,820
And there's that funny smell.

547
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:09,420
But the resemblance is uncanny.

548
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:16,880
It's as if we're two characters in a movie
being played by the same actor.

549
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,260
But I need real proof!

550
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,400
Ivo, we have very little time.

551
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,140
But I could field a couple of queries.

552
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:28,520
Name the most elegant formula in
mathematics.

553
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,160
Euler's identity.

554
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,580
E to the i times pi plus one equals zilch.

555
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,280
European capitals arranged alphabetically
by the fourth letter.

556
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:37,940
Riga, Monaco, Sarajevo, Tirana.

557
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,734
The speed of light divided
by the speed of sound

558
00:40:39,735 --> 00:40:42,161
divided by the speed of
the bus and the movie speed.

559
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,320
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

560
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,400
17,893.33333.

561
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:46,800
Rounding up.

562
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:49,200
17,894 mph.

563
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,540
And for all the marbles.

564
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,000
Good.

565
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,920
I lost mine.

566
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,480
A rare lung disease.

567
00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:00,240
And the longest word in the English
dictionary.

568
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:05,300
In numinal ultra microscopic silico
-volcano-choleosis.

569
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:07,480
Pop, pop.

570
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,660
In the saggy flesh.

571
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:12,620
But looking pretty good for a hundred and
ten.

572
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:17,240
Oh, Grampy-poo.

573
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,520
Where have you been my entire life?

574
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:27,940
Wait.

575
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:29,760
Where have you been?

576
00:41:29,761 --> 00:41:30,960
My entire life!

577
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:36,560
Locked in a top-secret prison for the last
50 years.

578
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:40,240
Made it kind of hard to send Christmas
cards.

579
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:46,160
Now, you're probably wondering why I
brought you here.

580
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,420
You didn't bring me here.

581
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:51,120
I used my unparalleled intellect to track
you down.

582
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:54,480
Heard the plan I concocted with my
unparalleled intellect.

583
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,360
You'll see.

584
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:59,600
I have the answer to everything.

585
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,060
Come on, kiddo.

586
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:17,560
I don't know.

587
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:19,060
I don't know.

588
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:22,940
Someone tell me this is some kind of
concussion-induced nightmare?

589
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,620
There's two Eggmen now?

590
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,640
Double your villains, double your fun.

591
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,280
Two robotniks are way worse than one.

592
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,060
Chest bump?

593
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,120
No.

594
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:35,780
Stone, why are you tied up?

595
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,220
Do that on your own time, you sicken me.

596
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,340
You must be the long-lost grandson.

597
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,420
And you must be another stinking hedgehog.

598
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,680
So you're the one behind all this?

599
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:47,900
The shadow breakout?

600
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,180
The attack on Walters?

601
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,640
That musty old man smell?

602
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:54,340
How dare you insult me with your
unsolicited exposition?

603
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,040
Shadow, get the key.

604
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:57,920
Where is it?

605
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:58,380
Ha!

606
00:42:58,740 --> 00:42:59,860
Good one, Hot Topic.

607
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:02,220
Do you really think we'd be that stupid?

608
00:43:02,221 --> 00:43:04,240
To bring the key right to you?

609
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:06,140
Yep, we're that stupid.

610
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,300
Gun took everything from us.

611
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:11,580
And now we are going to take everything
from them.

612
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:16,380
With this, my masterpiece of malevolence.

613
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,020
The Eclipse Cannon.

614
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:23,589
In exchange for my
freedom, I gave Gun the

615
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:27,440
most powerful weapon
mankind has ever seen.

616
00:43:27,441 --> 00:43:32,280
Capable of delivering a precision strike
anywhere on Earth.

617
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:36,780
Our first target, Gun Headquarters.

618
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,760
But firing a weapon that powerful could
threaten millions of innocent lives.

619
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:43,160
Yeah, Terra bite me.

620
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:48,760
This is one of two keys required to launch
the Eclipse Cannon.

621
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,420
The other is locked inside Gun
Headquarters.

622
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,640
Once we have both, I will take rightful
control of my weapon.

623
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,440
I'm in.

624
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:06,780
Holy crap!

625
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:08,620
Spacious and crustaceous.

626
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:12,400
Thank you so much for inspiring this
little adventure.

627
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:14,820
It really worked out for me.

628
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:18,180
And you wonder why I have trust issues.

629
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:20,700
Shadow, wait.

630
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:21,900
Don't do this.

631
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:25,860
I know you're hurting, but don't let that
change who you are inside.

632
00:44:25,861 --> 00:44:30,080
I've spent 50 years reliving what they did
to her.

633
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:33,240
This is who I am inside.

634
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,120
Nice magic marble.

635
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,600
Real scary.

636
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,840
That actually is real scary.

637
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:52,480
It's a mini black hole.

638
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:55,020
It's going to suck in all the matter in
this base.

639
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:01,960
Fear not, friends.

640
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,620
Even my teeth are muscles.

641
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,400
Sonic,

642
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:12,680
try to reach one of my rings.

643
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,440
Got one.

644
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:15,540
Check this out.

645
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:16,620
Trickshot.

646
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:21,540
Come on.

647
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,980
Come on.

648
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:25,840
Come on.

649
00:45:25,841 --> 00:45:28,940
Come on!

650
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:49,390
Call Google Maps.

651
00:45:53,410 --> 00:46:00,730
I've spent years trying to cleanse the
cosmos of that spiny blue speed freak.

652
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:02,900
And you did it.

653
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:06,010
In one afternoon.

654
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:08,810
There's nothing we can't destroy.

655
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:10,530
Together, my boy.

656
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:13,750
Charting route to gun headquarters in
London, sirs.

657
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:15,350
ETA four hours.

658
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,190
As the crap flies.

659
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:19,370
By all accounts, we're ahead of schedule.

660
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:24,510
We should take this time to get to know
each other better.

661
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:25,790
Wow.

662
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:27,330
What?

663
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:30,770
You mean spend some qua-qua-qua?

664
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,330
All at any time?

665
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:35,730
You've read it for this your whole life.

666
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:43,270
How would you choose to spend one perfect
day with your new grand-pal?

667
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,200
Live without him.

668
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:54,660
But let's talk about him.

669
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:20,680
And done.

670
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:21,800
Masterpiece.

671
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:22,480
Look at that.

672
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:23,280
Yay!

673
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:27,280
It's really been great having time to
ourselves.

674
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:27,740
Right.

675
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:28,580
Absolutely.

676
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:31,100
I just feel so relaxed, you know?

677
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:31,600
Clear-headed.

678
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,080
Look at all these new interests we've
found.

679
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:35,240
So many hobbies.

680
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:36,080
So many.

681
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:40,480
After the action and adventure of the last
few years, I could get used to this.

682
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,500
Same.

683
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:50,701
Tom and Maddy, we need your help
on a super... Knuckles, do you mind?

684
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:52,080
Oh, excuse me.

685
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:56,120
Tom and Maddy, we need your help on a
super dangerous top secret mission.

686
00:48:58,820 --> 00:48:59,380
Thank God.

687
00:48:59,381 --> 00:48:59,660
Let's go.

688
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:00,480
Yeah, we're in.

689
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:01,180
Really?

690
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:02,040
You're in?

691
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:02,940
Just like that?

692
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:03,380
Yes.

693
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:05,960
It was getting so boring without you guys
here.

694
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:06,420
No offense.

695
00:49:06,421 --> 00:49:06,820
Boring.

696
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:07,700
No, none taken.

697
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:10,480
I mean, whatever crazy plan you're cooking
up, the answer's yes.

698
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,760
Great, but first things first,
what is that?

699
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:15,480
Oh, this is...

700
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:17,540
Little Tom.

701
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:18,620
Isn't he great?

702
00:49:20,270 --> 00:49:21,520
I told you to get rid of that.

703
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:22,730
It's very creepy.

704
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,200
That's all I'm gonna get rid of you.

705
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:26,140
Okay, that's crossing a line.

706
00:49:26,141 --> 00:49:27,221
You are in so much trouble.

707
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:31,640
Okay, this is it.

708
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:32,880
The belly of the beast.

709
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,720
Gun headquarters in London.

710
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:38,400
Tom, we're finally gonna get to see London
together.

711
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,500
Hey, I told you we'd get there someday,
baby.

712
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,460
Okay, so here's the plan.

713
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,500
I run in super fast.

714
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:46,680
Fly over that water, no problem.

715
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:50,001
Then right when
I get to the... Ah!

716
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,200
What just happened?

717
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:52,240
Congratulations.

718
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:54,860
You just got incinerated by their energy
shield.

719
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:58,700
We'll need to shut it down by planting a
USB drive in their server room.

720
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:00,660
That will give me full control over it.

721
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,880
That's what we need you two for.

722
00:50:02,881 --> 00:50:04,940
Couple badass spies, that's what we are.

723
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:06,020
Mr. and Mrs. Smith.

724
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:10,380
Once we disable the shield, you'll face
the laser hall.

725
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,220
These high density bad boys will cut you
into tiny pieces.

726
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,580
And cut those pieces into even tinier
pieces.

727
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,660
Once again, can't we just get Tom Cruise
to do this?

728
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:27,560
Nope, because not even he could break into
the vault.

729
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,440
Why is it empty in there?

730
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:32,380
Because we have no idea what's on the
other side of that door.

731
00:50:32,381 --> 00:50:36,300
To prevent the vault from ever being
accessed by a ring, all images and

732
00:50:36,301 --> 00:50:38,320
schematics have been wiped from Gunn's
database.

733
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:40,380
So for the last leg of this heist...

734
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:43,360
We're going in blind.

735
00:50:50,205 --> 00:50:51,460
Okay, I'm just gonna say it.

736
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:55,860
It sounds like this plan will work a heck
of a lot better if Sonic used the Master

737
00:50:55,861 --> 00:50:58,700
Emerald to go golden god mode to get the
key.

738
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:00,920
No way, Maddy.

739
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:03,800
The Master Emerald is too powerful to ever
use again.

740
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:06,400
We made a promise to each other to keep it
hidden.

741
00:51:06,625 --> 00:51:08,740
In a location only Knuckles knows.

742
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:12,330
As guardian of the Master
Emerald, anyone who tries to

743
00:51:12,331 --> 00:51:15,980
take it away for any reason
will become a sworn enemy.

744
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,440
Okay, sheesh.

745
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,320
No need to get all growly on me,
buddy.

746
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:23,120
You guys are always telling us to make
good choices.

747
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:25,220
Well, this is the right choice.

748
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:29,400
Okay, I guess we're going to...

749
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:41,140
When Casey died in London, when I got Bad
Man ready to shut it down.

750
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:43,400
Bad Man ready to shut it down.

751
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,520
London, baby!

752
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:52,740
Gunn headquarters is right there.

753
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:57,060
Let me go in, get the key, and destroy
anyone in my way.

754
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,520
I want revenge.

755
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:02,480
Patient Shadow, just let us handle this.

756
00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:10,560
And I promise you'll have revenge on a
scale you couldn't possibly imagine.

757
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:12,640
Come on, Grand Daddio.

758
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,300
We've got dirt to do.

759
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,160
Suits.

760
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:18,520
Right here, sir.

761
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:21,400
Stone, babysit the hedgehog.

762
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:23,180
Keep the crab on a low boil.

763
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:27,000
It's time for more family bonding.

764
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:32,940
Come on, Shadow.

765
00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:35,800
Got fresh avocados in the crab.

766
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:37,680
We'll make guac.

767
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,160
Revenge guac.

768
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:51,450
Guys, are you ready for me yet?

769
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:53,350
I've been waiting here all day.

770
00:52:56,530 --> 00:52:58,990
Sonic, we literally just started.

771
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:01,590
Tom, Maddie, are you in position and
ready?

772
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:03,050
We were born ready.

773
00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:03,730
Let's do this.

774
00:53:03,731 --> 00:53:05,310
Knuckles, how about you?

775
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:07,730
I have taken my perch atop the giant
clock.

776
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:10,590
Now, where is this glass I'm supposed to
break?

777
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:14,750
Actually, Knucks, your job is to break
glass in case of emergency.

778
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:15,830
Understood.

779
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:19,810
I will shatter this glass like the jaw of
a vile foal.

780
00:53:20,210 --> 00:53:21,810
In case of emergency.

781
00:53:22,110 --> 00:53:24,870
I will plow arising like the skull of a
loathsome bridal.

782
00:53:24,890 --> 00:53:28,150
Just to be clear, the emergency is the
important part.

783
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:32,770
The glass will beg for mercy under the
shadow of my mighty fist.

784
00:53:32,771 --> 00:53:34,130
Guys, remember, we're a team.

785
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:34,870
Now let's focus.

786
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:35,450
Please.

787
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:36,130
You know what?

788
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:37,250
Let's move on.

789
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:38,990
All right, everyone knows what to do.

790
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:41,270
Tom and Maddie, you guys plant the USB
drive.

791
00:53:41,490 --> 00:53:42,530
I'll disable the traps.

792
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:44,090
Sonic will snag the lunch key.

793
00:53:44,270 --> 00:53:48,010
And Knuckles, you stand by to...
Break glass in case of emergency.

794
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:49,070
See?

795
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:50,430
He gets it.

796
00:53:50,490 --> 00:53:51,490
Then we're all set.

797
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:53,210
Hologram time.

798
00:53:54,910 --> 00:53:55,910
You go first.

799
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,550
Tom, it's me, Rachel.

800
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:00,510
Can you believe it?

801
00:54:00,511 --> 00:54:01,711
We're both in London together.

802
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:02,930
Have you met your sister?

803
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:04,090
Try again.

804
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:06,821
Unless you're not up for this mission.

805
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:09,530
Yeah, maybe you want to be back in Green
Hills baking sourdough and...

806
00:54:09,531 --> 00:54:10,690
Thomas Michael Wachowski?

807
00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:10,950
Yeah.

808
00:54:11,170 --> 00:54:13,010
You brought aliens to
my wedding, punched

809
00:54:13,011 --> 00:54:14,690
out my husband and
buried me in an avalanche.

810
00:54:15,010 --> 00:54:17,030
Your day of reckoning is at hand.

811
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:18,290
Yeah, that's perfect.

812
00:54:19,070 --> 00:54:20,270
Okay, now for her better half.

813
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:26,650
My name is Randall, and I am too much to
handle.

814
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:29,010
Welcome to the gun show.

815
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:33,430
Baby, would you describe me as jacked,
juiced, or shredded?

816
00:54:34,930 --> 00:54:36,610
I would describe your head as swollen.

817
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:38,130
Let's get to work.

818
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:43,260
Agent Randall, handle.

819
00:54:44,105 --> 00:54:46,220
I'm here to have lunch with my lovely
wife, Rachel.

820
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:47,840
I'm sorry, Agent Randall.

821
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,960
This facility is currently locked down.

822
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:51,840
Command level clearance only.

823
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:53,820
One minute.

824
00:54:55,095 --> 00:54:57,460
Tails, we have a problem here.

825
00:54:57,610 --> 00:55:00,300
They must have tightened security after
Shadow's escape.

826
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:01,860
I got this.

827
00:55:03,390 --> 00:55:04,580
You must be new here.

828
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:06,260
Allow me to introduce myself.

829
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:07,380
My name is Rachel.

830
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:09,240
Rachel gonna get you fired.

831
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:12,240
Do you know what gun stands for?

832
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,320
Of course, Guardian Unit.

833
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:17,540
Getting ultra nasty.

834
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:22,240
Do you want me to get ultra nasty?

835
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:24,240
Nasty nasty?

836
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:25,220
No, ma'am.

837
00:55:25,221 --> 00:55:26,221
Okay, then.

838
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:30,140
Then go ahead and take those little sad
fingers and start tippity-tack-tack-tack.

839
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:31,180
Mm-hmm.

840
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:31,760
That's right.

841
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:32,960
Go on.

842
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:35,381
Sorry for the inconvenience, ma'am.

843
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:36,480
Mm-hmm.

844
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:38,760
That's what I thought.

845
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,560
My God, I love being Rachel.

846
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:55,730
Did it work?

847
00:55:56,450 --> 00:55:57,450
Yeah.

848
00:55:57,950 --> 00:55:58,950
Ow!

849
00:56:01,330 --> 00:56:03,730
Director Rockwell, seeking access to the
server room.

850
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:05,250
Just one moment, ma'am.

851
00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:07,050
Oh, no.

852
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:07,970
No, no, no, it's her.

853
00:56:08,110 --> 00:56:08,290
It's her.

854
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:09,410
It's the real her.

855
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:13,230
What do we do?

856
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:15,650
Okay, did it work?

857
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:18,430
What's going on?

858
00:56:19,130 --> 00:56:20,270
What am I doing wrong?

859
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:22,710
Ow!

860
00:56:23,370 --> 00:56:24,370
Aye, aye, captain.

861
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,520
Aye, aye, captain.

862
00:56:29,521 --> 00:56:30,900
Who are you, Popeye?

863
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:31,600
I panicked.

864
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:32,200
I was joking.

865
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:32,680
Jeez!

866
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:34,140
Get it together.

867
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:38,860
Okay, Tails.

868
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:39,920
What are we looking for?

869
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:41,840
Security servers in the seventh row.

870
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,180
Twenty-third cabinet.

871
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,080
Are you guys finished yet?

872
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:47,320
This is taking forever.

873
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:50,180
Uh-oh.

874
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,260
Has the time come to break the glass?

875
00:56:52,830 --> 00:56:53,951
Or at least break something?

876
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:55,140
All right, hang tight, guys.

877
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,640
Maddy's about to insert the drive.

878
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:57,920
Ready?

879
00:56:57,921 --> 00:57:04,320
Three, two, one, go.

880
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:09,890
It didn't work.

881
00:57:10,070 --> 00:57:11,206
Did you put it in the right way?

882
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:11,990
Try punching it.

883
00:57:12,210 --> 00:57:13,790
Do not try punching it.

884
00:57:14,070 --> 00:57:15,930
Oh, take it out and blow on it.

885
00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:16,990
Yes!

886
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:18,370
Oh, come on, Tom.

887
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:21,850
There's absolutely no sign of the big
evidence to support.

888
00:57:24,745 --> 00:57:26,050
Never mind, it worked.

889
00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:27,390
A little trick from the 90s.

890
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:29,470
I mean, best decade ever, right?

891
00:57:29,570 --> 00:57:32,090
I'm shutting down the outside sensors now.

892
00:57:32,110 --> 00:57:33,110
Yes.

893
00:57:33,710 --> 00:57:37,810
Hold on, is there supposed to be another
USB drive here?

894
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:39,650
One with a giant mustache on it?

895
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:41,650
Oh, no.

896
00:57:41,870 --> 00:57:45,470
I've got two heat signatures en route to
the vault, which can only mean...

897
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:54,580
Our robotics have entered the chat.

898
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,240
Wait.

899
00:57:57,980 --> 00:57:58,980
Puppy seat?

900
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:01,700
Grand geezer.

901
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:03,620
Donde esta?

902
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:04,920
I'm right here.

903
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:08,820
If you weren't family, I could have got
you like a pheasant.

904
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,521
I mean... Try to keep up.

905
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:18,840
And now back to la oritima passion.

906
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:23,940
Oritima passion can only belong to one.

907
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:25,420
No.

908
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:29,000
It can only belong to one.

909
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:31,880
Gabriella, she killed them both.

910
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:34,660
She's not a prize to be won.

911
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:36,880
Kill this, murder that...

912
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:39,000
You need to lighten up, Shadow.

913
00:58:39,495 --> 00:58:40,696
We're about to rule the world.

914
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:45,540
When we're done, there won't be anything
left to rule.

915
00:58:46,370 --> 00:58:48,620
That is dark, even for you.

916
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:51,300
What are you and the professor up to?

917
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:53,640
Hello, what's this?

918
00:58:54,090 --> 00:58:56,340
I knew I saw an outside signal.

919
00:58:57,580 --> 00:59:00,580
Cheerio, I guess someone forgot to flush.

920
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:24,120
What now, my cunning cohort?

921
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:26,400
Just a little teamwork.

922
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:34,700
Hey.

923
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:40,480
The lasers... don't seem
to be penetrating my suit.

924
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:44,760
They're conforming to the shape of my
bodacious bard.

925
00:59:44,761 --> 00:59:45,340
They're conforming to the shape of my
bodacious bard.

926
00:59:45,341 --> 00:59:46,580
Of course.

927
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:53,000
I designed these suits to create a field
of laser-bending thermal distortion.

928
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,160
Wasn't sure it would work till now.

929
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:59,400
You're a heartless son, rotten to the
core.

930
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:04,740
I'm... So now we can
just dance right through.

931
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:08,940
That sounds like a challenge.

932
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:17,340
Caught him right up.

933
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,120
Don't hold back.

934
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:27,800
Cause you woke up in the morning with the
initiative to move so I'll make it harder.

935
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:28,960
Don't hold back.

936
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:32,220
If you think about it, so many people do
be cool and look smarter.

937
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:33,600
Don't hold back.

938
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:36,900
And you shouldn't even care about the
those in the air and the crooked stairs.

939
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:38,100
Don't hold back.

940
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:41,520
Cause there's a party over here so you may
as well be here with the people care.

941
01:00:41,521 --> 01:00:42,920
Don't hold back.

942
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:44,940
The world is out of date.

943
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:48,920
The time has come to... galvanize.

944
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,280
Come on, come on, come on.

945
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:58,420
My finger is on the button.

946
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:00,180
Push the button.

947
01:01:16,930 --> 01:01:19,090
The robotics are almost at the vault.

948
01:01:19,490 --> 01:01:20,490
We're out of time.

949
01:01:20,650 --> 01:01:21,230
I'm going.

950
01:01:21,670 --> 01:01:22,470
No, Sonic.

951
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:24,510
I haven't disabled the trap yet.

952
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:27,150
Too late.

953
01:01:28,330 --> 01:01:28,830
Look at me.

954
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:31,030
I'm running on the wrong side of the road.

955
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:35,870
Well, I've got to take in the sights.

956
01:01:36,270 --> 01:01:37,870
Paul, John, George, the other one.

957
01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:40,210
Loud American coming through.

958
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:41,110
Excuse me.

959
01:01:41,210 --> 01:01:41,670
Pardon me.

960
01:01:41,730 --> 01:01:42,370
Hello, Ga-Ga.

961
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:43,490
We quit Hogwarts?

962
01:01:43,710 --> 01:01:44,790
Hear ye, hear ye.

963
01:01:45,030 --> 01:01:47,270
Sonic the Hedgehog wants a cup of tea.

964
01:01:47,890 --> 01:01:48,890
Hold this for me, please.

965
01:01:50,350 --> 01:01:51,810
You're not going to make it.

966
01:01:51,970 --> 01:01:53,010
I can make it.

967
01:01:56,470 --> 01:01:57,930
You're not going to make it.

968
01:01:58,110 --> 01:01:59,550
I'm going to make it.

969
01:02:00,870 --> 01:02:02,210
I'm not going to make it.

970
01:02:02,670 --> 01:02:04,430
I'm not going to make it.

971
01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:10,710
Made it.

972
01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:13,590
Excuse me.

973
01:02:13,690 --> 01:02:14,050
Coming through.

974
01:02:14,210 --> 01:02:15,210
No time for autographs.

975
01:02:15,270 --> 01:02:15,590
Gotta go.

976
01:02:15,950 --> 01:02:16,950
Bye.

977
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:26,140
Our destiny awaits.

978
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:29,420
Stop right there, robo scum.

979
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:30,840
Let's do this.

980
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:32,060
Coming.

981
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:40,480
Too slow, Eggman.

982
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:43,760
Now, if you don't mind, I've got to get
that key.

983
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:45,420
Whoa.

984
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:45,820
My feet.

985
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:47,560
Why can't I use my beautiful feet?

986
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:52,420
Because this vault is armed with variable
gravity.

987
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:55,100
No kidding.

988
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:59,580
Green goes up and red takes you down hard.

989
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:00,920
Rockwell, listen to me.

990
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:02,400
The Robotniks are planning to...

991
01:03:02,401 --> 01:03:05,060
Oh, they're planning on stealing the
second key just like you are?

992
01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:06,220
Yes, I'm aware.

993
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:08,780
I called it.

994
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:10,640
The second Commander Walters was attacked.

995
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:16,740
So, thank you for taking the bait and
falling right into my trap.

996
01:03:17,330 --> 01:03:19,140
I don't believe this.

997
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:20,560
I know, grandson.

998
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:22,720
A woman in the military.

999
01:03:24,860 --> 01:03:25,860
Let's go.

1000
01:03:31,830 --> 01:03:32,830
Robotnik.

1001
01:03:32,990 --> 01:03:34,310
You're calling full spandex, huh?

1002
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:35,350
Who's the fossil?

1003
01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:39,670
That's my grandfather, you dough-eating
dimbutsill.

1004
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:40,770
Who's there?

1005
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:45,950
A couple of bleeding hearts here to rescue
their emotional support animals.

1006
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:47,110
Enough.

1007
01:03:47,150 --> 01:03:48,150
It's over.

1008
01:03:48,515 --> 01:03:51,430
The only way you're leaving here is in
handcuffs.

1009
01:03:52,390 --> 01:03:53,710
There is no other way out.

1010
01:03:54,110 --> 01:03:56,750
You know, there might be one other way
out.

1011
01:03:56,970 --> 01:03:58,266
And what is that supposed to mean?

1012
01:03:58,290 --> 01:03:58,850
Hey, big guy.

1013
01:03:59,110 --> 01:04:00,630
I think it's time to...

1014
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:04,150
Break class in case of emergency!

1015
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,850
Nothing can stop Team Knuckles.

1016
01:04:15,710 --> 01:04:16,710
Open fire!

1017
01:04:17,830 --> 01:04:19,590
Knuckles, turn the stuff off!

1018
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:20,150
Hurry!

1019
01:04:20,510 --> 01:04:21,510
On it!

1020
01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:23,510
Uh-oh.

1021
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:28,430
Ha!

1022
01:04:31,990 --> 01:04:34,110
See how you like...

1023
01:04:40,370 --> 01:04:41,830
Can you move?

1024
01:04:41,930 --> 01:04:42,930
No, not at all.

1025
01:04:43,570 --> 01:04:44,210
Tails, can you?

1026
01:04:44,430 --> 01:04:44,770
No!

1027
01:04:45,070 --> 01:04:45,970
I'm stuck!

1028
01:04:45,971 --> 01:04:47,630
We might be here a while.

1029
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:53,930
Where's the key?

1030
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:01,640
Whoa!

1031
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:02,940
What was that?

1032
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,220
We might have a problem.

1033
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:30,620
I'm moving!

1034
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:33,150
I'm moving!

1035
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,860
Well, go get it, grandson!

1036
01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:41,220
Hey!

1037
01:05:41,660 --> 01:05:43,060
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1038
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:47,700
No, no, no!

1039
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:49,840
I'm almost there!

1040
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,200
Sonic!

1041
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:16,320
That was so not worth it!

1042
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:21,700
You okay?

1043
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:23,080
Yeah, I'm good.

1044
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:23,640
Sonic!

1045
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:25,180
Hey.

1046
01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:29,380
Sonic one, concrete boulder zero.

1047
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Thanks for the save.

1048
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:33,960
Getting a little close, don't you think?

1049
01:06:35,070 --> 01:06:36,070
Secure the room!

1050
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:39,400
She's got the key.

1051
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:43,280
I got an idea.

1052
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:53,780
Commander Walters.

1053
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:57,441
Sir, you're... Still alive?

1054
01:06:57,730 --> 01:07:00,680
I'll die before I let that key fall into
the wrong hands.

1055
01:07:00,930 --> 01:07:02,600
Thanks for keeping it safe.

1056
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,660
I'll take it from here.

1057
01:07:07,070 --> 01:07:08,960
That's an order, Director Rockwell.

1058
01:07:13,150 --> 01:07:15,130
Now, organize the reinforcements.

1059
01:07:16,810 --> 01:07:17,810
Yes, sir.

1060
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:24,980
Guys, guys, I got the key.

1061
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:26,120
I repeat, I got the key.

1062
01:07:26,140 --> 01:07:27,260
Now, let's get out of here.

1063
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:33,480
Commander Walters.

1064
01:07:34,820 --> 01:07:36,280
No, no, no, wait!

1065
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:51,520
What?

1066
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:53,440
Tom, everyone's clear!

1067
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:54,580
Come on, let's go!

1068
01:07:55,050 --> 01:07:58,400
You, what are you...

1069
01:07:58,860 --> 01:07:59,860
Tom!

1070
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:02,380
Tom, Tom, what happened?

1071
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:04,380
Speak to me, come on.

1072
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:06,520
Come on, come on, come on, it's gonna be
okay.

1073
01:08:07,155 --> 01:08:08,580
Please, please, please, get up.

1074
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:10,300
Come on, please, wake up.

1075
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:11,940
Wake up, wake up, wake up, come on!

1076
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:14,280
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up!

1077
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:17,140
Maria...

1078
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:21,680
What did you do?

1079
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:25,900
What I had to.

1080
01:08:28,780 --> 01:08:30,200
Oh, my God, Tom!

1081
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:35,000
Help me up, Tim!

1082
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,080
Freeze!

1083
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:39,900
Come on!

1084
01:08:40,425 --> 01:08:44,340
Any tricks up your sleeve, Captain
Burntastic?

1085
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:53,520
We got what we came for.

1086
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:56,760
Great job, Shadow.

1087
01:08:58,210 --> 01:09:00,420
We have both keys.

1088
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:03,440
So where's your little science project?

1089
01:09:05,390 --> 01:09:08,580
It's closer than you think, my boy.

1090
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:15,860
Welcome to my masterpiece.

1091
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:21,140
I must hand it to Gunn.

1092
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:24,460
They built her to my exact specifications.

1093
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:29,300
It's... remarkable.

1094
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:32,600
Astounding.

1095
01:09:33,180 --> 01:09:34,180
Yes.

1096
01:09:35,330 --> 01:09:37,320
That's my genius, Gran Gino.

1097
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:40,540
And I have one more surprise.

1098
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:46,900
It's a new suit!

1099
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:48,440
What?

1100
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:20,120
I'm a chip off the old block.

1101
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:22,440
I'm a chip off the old block.

1102
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:25,260
I'm a chip off the old block!

1103
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:28,180
What do you want, Stone?

1104
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:29,220
I'm busy.

1105
01:10:29,740 --> 01:10:32,000
Doctor, I have a bad feeling about this.

1106
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:35,380
I don't think your grandfather's been
completely honest with us.

1107
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:37,260
It was something Shadow said.

1108
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:39,540
There's more to their plan.

1109
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,380
How dare you!

1110
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:48,480
You've been jealous of my long-lost
grandpop, Tartt, since the very beginning.

1111
01:10:49,670 --> 01:10:52,440
I no longer require your obsequious
groveling.

1112
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,640
Consider this your notice of termination.

1113
01:10:55,140 --> 01:10:57,900
Your letter of reference will be ill for
loser.

1114
01:10:59,170 --> 01:11:02,171
Of course, I'll expect you to stay on
until you've been successfully cloned.

1115
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:05,080
But you and I are done!

1116
01:11:06,190 --> 01:11:08,420
Like a blackened catfish dinner!

1117
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:11,920
Sir, it's too dangerous and I'm not there
to protect you.

1118
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:13,420
I already lost you once!

1119
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:15,120
Unsubscribed, blocked and reported.

1120
01:11:17,010 --> 01:11:18,220
I can't lose you again.

1121
01:11:25,410 --> 01:11:28,260
Do the honors, grandson.

1122
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:31,540
Here we go.

1123
01:13:08,170 --> 01:13:09,620
It'll be okay, Sonic.

1124
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:11,360
It'll be okay?

1125
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:14,540
Tom is fighting for his life and you think
it'll be okay?

1126
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:17,820
The fox is simply trying to comfort you.

1127
01:13:18,580 --> 01:13:20,020
Comfort's not what I need right now.

1128
01:13:20,420 --> 01:13:21,440
I need to stop them.

1129
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:23,280
By any means necessary.

1130
01:13:23,780 --> 01:13:26,760
Wait, you don't mean...
The Master Emerald.

1131
01:13:27,380 --> 01:13:30,080
The Emerald must never be wielded for
vengeance.

1132
01:13:30,820 --> 01:13:31,820
Not ever.

1133
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:33,220
We swore that it would be okay.

1134
01:13:33,915 --> 01:13:35,360
Don't talk to me about Oats.

1135
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:36,020
Not now.

1136
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:39,320
But you told Tom using the Emerald wasn't
the right choice.

1137
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:41,680
Well, now it's the only choice.

1138
01:13:42,070 --> 01:13:45,220
And if neither of you have the guts to
help me, then I'll do it alone.

1139
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:47,720
But I thought the three of us were a team.

1140
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:49,900
I thought that's what made us special.

1141
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:52,220
I'm not asking you twice, Knuckles.

1142
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:55,220
Where is the Master Emerald?

1143
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:00,800
Your heart is being consumed by anger,
Hedgehog.

1144
01:14:00,801 --> 01:14:04,220
You are in no condition to make decisions
right now.

1145
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:06,000
I know you're upset about Tom.

1146
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:07,440
We all are.

1147
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:08,600
Last chance.

1148
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:11,200
Where is it?

1149
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:13,520
Don't do this.

1150
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:23,600
Part of our oath is to trust each other.

1151
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:28,680
And I must abide by that promise,
even if you have chosen to break it.

1152
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,320
But heed this warning.

1153
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:35,680
The Master Emerald is guarded by a
fearsome warrior and to seize this

1154
01:14:35,681 --> 01:14:40,520
ultimate power, you will have to go
through him.

1155
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:43,280
Okay, Wade.

1156
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:44,940
All comes down to this.

1157
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:47,500
Last few seconds.

1158
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:49,080
Whipple down the ice.

1159
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:49,820
He shoots!

1160
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:51,300
He scores!

1161
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:55,780
Wayne Whipple is a champion again!

1162
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:03,040
Oh, hey, Sonic.

1163
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:03,960
You see my goal?

1164
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:05,480
Pretty sick, right?

1165
01:15:05,780 --> 01:15:07,080
I'm here for the Emerald.

1166
01:15:07,820 --> 01:15:09,160
Look, Sonic, I'm sorry.

1167
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:11,440
I promised to guard this Emerald with my
life.

1168
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:13,380
I will do whatever it takes.

1169
01:15:14,830 --> 01:15:15,830
Well, I tried.

1170
01:15:30,610 --> 01:15:33,490
This is an urgent national emergency
broadcast.

1171
01:15:34,850 --> 01:15:37,144
A spacecraft designed by
the Agency Gun has been

1172
01:15:37,145 --> 01:15:39,871
hijacked and launched
out of the River Thames.

1173
01:15:45,210 --> 01:15:48,910
All residents are urged to seek immediate
shelter.

1174
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:19,160
Professor, is this really what Maria would
have wanted?

1175
01:16:22,515 --> 01:16:25,500
The question isn't what Maria would have
wanted.

1176
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:28,600
It's what do they deserve?

1177
01:16:30,180 --> 01:16:32,520
Remember what she meant to us.

1178
01:16:34,740 --> 01:16:37,280
Remember what they took from us.

1179
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:49,500
Kids!

1180
01:16:49,540 --> 01:16:51,100
We have to go, now!

1181
01:16:56,300 --> 01:16:58,920
They want to take Shadow away from us,
Maria!

1182
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:08,960
Hey!

1183
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:09,900
What are you doing?

1184
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:10,580
Those are children!

1185
01:17:10,940 --> 01:17:12,280
We've got our orders on us!

1186
01:17:12,281 --> 01:17:13,281
Stand down!

1187
01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:40,620
Maria!

1188
01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:32,280
Excuse me, Grand Pasadoble.

1189
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:35,600
What is that thermal nuclear journal
doing?

1190
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:39,700
Infusing the core with Chaos energy.

1191
01:18:40,620 --> 01:18:42,100
That's my little secret.

1192
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:47,980
The Eclipse Cannon is about to turn this
planet into a flaming pile of rubble,

1193
01:18:48,780 --> 01:18:50,140
wiping out everything.

1194
01:18:50,141 --> 01:18:53,300
And a 25,000 mile radius.

1195
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Including us.

1196
01:19:04,380 --> 01:19:05,220
What?!

1197
01:19:05,270 --> 01:19:08,440
We can't annihilate the Earth?

1198
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:12,920
By combining our genius, we can rule
humanity.

1199
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:14,540
Together!

1200
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:16,860
Humanity is a failed experiment.

1201
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:20,060
If anyone should know that, it's you.

1202
01:19:21,220 --> 01:19:24,220
All your life you've been rejected by this
world.

1203
01:19:25,820 --> 01:19:27,500
You have nothing down there.

1204
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:30,920
No one who cares about you.

1205
01:19:33,105 --> 01:19:34,460
But I have you now.

1206
01:19:37,460 --> 01:19:38,460
We're family.

1207
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:40,700
We have each other.

1208
01:19:42,940 --> 01:19:43,940
Oh, Ivo.

1209
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:47,160
You're no Maria.

1210
01:19:50,690 --> 01:19:54,590
The moment I lost her, my family was gone
forever.

1211
01:19:56,810 --> 01:19:58,552
The only way to give
Maria's life meaning is

1212
01:19:58,553 --> 01:20:01,791
to destroy the world
that took her from me.

1213
01:20:02,090 --> 01:20:03,770
So I'm burning it all down!

1214
01:20:06,750 --> 01:20:07,790
It's done.

1215
01:20:08,650 --> 01:20:09,770
Good work, Shadow.

1216
01:20:10,710 --> 01:20:12,370
I'm prepping the firing sequence.

1217
01:20:13,430 --> 01:20:16,210
The weapon will be fully charged in 10
minutes.

1218
01:20:20,150 --> 01:20:22,690
It's almost finished, Maria.

1219
01:20:23,830 --> 01:20:25,550
You will have justice.

1220
01:20:30,010 --> 01:20:31,850
What is that?

1221
01:20:32,990 --> 01:20:35,490
His gun launching missiles at us?

1222
01:20:36,270 --> 01:20:37,270
Impossible.

1223
01:20:37,550 --> 01:20:38,830
It's moving too fast.

1224
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:43,550
It's him.

1225
01:20:54,630 --> 01:20:56,690
This ends now!

1226
01:20:56,850 --> 01:20:59,010
Now you know my anger.

1227
01:20:59,430 --> 01:21:02,090
The pain I've felt for 50 years.

1228
01:21:02,810 --> 01:21:05,830
And you've made the same choice I did.

1229
01:21:06,190 --> 01:21:07,390
I'm nothing like you!

1230
01:21:07,810 --> 01:21:08,810
We'll see.

1231
01:21:16,790 --> 01:21:18,190
Show yourself, coward!

1232
01:21:49,870 --> 01:21:52,830
You were right about one thing.

1233
01:21:53,610 --> 01:21:56,690
This ends now.

1234
01:22:23,510 --> 01:22:24,610
What's happening?

1235
01:22:25,470 --> 01:22:26,470
Where are they?

1236
01:22:27,490 --> 01:22:27,930
Up there.

1237
01:22:28,350 --> 01:22:28,550
Where?

1238
01:22:28,970 --> 01:22:29,230
Higher.

1239
01:22:29,970 --> 01:22:32,530
Left yourself open.

1240
01:22:33,150 --> 01:22:34,750
What are you doing?

1241
01:22:35,170 --> 01:22:36,490
Porting your evil plan!

1242
01:22:47,260 --> 01:22:48,540
Not the mustache!

1243
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:49,600
Green!

1244
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:50,680
Let go of three.

1245
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:52,500
One, two, three!

1246
01:22:57,850 --> 01:23:00,830
Oh, a narrow fist.

1247
01:23:01,450 --> 01:23:04,930
I haven't seen that since I hate-watched
Green Lantern in 2011.

1248
01:23:05,630 --> 01:23:07,190
I was saving it for Comic-Con.

1249
01:23:07,510 --> 01:23:09,790
But now there won't be a Comic-Con!

1250
01:23:33,950 --> 01:23:35,590
Where are your friends?

1251
01:23:37,675 --> 01:23:39,630
They tried to stop you, didn't they?

1252
01:23:40,170 --> 01:23:41,530
But you came anyway.

1253
01:23:41,531 --> 01:23:43,850
Your anger was too much.

1254
01:23:44,650 --> 01:23:49,070
What kind of hero abandons his friends to
pursue revenge?

1255
01:23:50,130 --> 01:23:51,770
Abandons his family?

1256
01:23:52,630 --> 01:23:54,670
Don't you dare talk about my family!

1257
01:23:55,290 --> 01:23:57,670
And here I thought you cared for them.

1258
01:23:58,190 --> 01:23:59,630
Especially the one...

1259
01:24:00,330 --> 01:24:01,330
What's his name?

1260
01:24:02,190 --> 01:24:03,190
Tom?

1261
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:24,800
No!

1262
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:30,760
Go ahead!

1263
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:32,240
Finish it!

1264
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:35,120
What are you waiting for?

1265
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:36,600
Do it!

1266
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:38,000
I'm right here!

1267
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:42,180
You didn't let your pain change who you
are.

1268
01:24:43,870 --> 01:24:44,870
In here.

1269
01:24:52,540 --> 01:24:54,960
This is not who I am.

1270
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:57,500
What are you doing?

1271
01:24:58,080 --> 01:24:59,080
You won!

1272
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:00,560
Take your revenge!

1273
01:25:02,900 --> 01:25:04,560
There are no winners with revenge.

1274
01:25:20,900 --> 01:25:21,900
Look at all those stars.

1275
01:25:23,510 --> 01:25:24,510
They're like diamonds.

1276
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:30,770
The last time I sat beneath stars like
this...

1277
01:25:33,060 --> 01:25:34,190
I was with her.

1278
01:25:36,270 --> 01:25:38,390
I've felt this pain for so long.

1279
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:41,630
It's all I know.

1280
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:46,330
When I lost Longclaw, I felt the same way.

1281
01:25:48,460 --> 01:25:50,590
Did your pain eventually go away?

1282
01:25:51,590 --> 01:25:52,590
No.

1283
01:25:53,305 --> 01:25:56,870
But in time, I learned there's something
even more powerful than pain.

1284
01:25:58,050 --> 01:25:59,710
The love we felt for each other.

1285
01:26:01,270 --> 01:26:03,090
That's what you need to hold on to,
Shadow.

1286
01:26:03,910 --> 01:26:07,430
Maria might be gone, but your love will
always remain.

1287
01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:26,480
The light shines, even though the star is
gone.

1288
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:40,460
This whole mess is my fault.

1289
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:46,060
I've been so blinded by rage, I thought I
had no choice.

1290
01:26:50,185 --> 01:26:51,840
You always have a choice.

1291
01:26:58,010 --> 01:27:00,130
Making the right one is never easy.

1292
01:27:01,190 --> 01:27:04,143
One more thing I learned
is that when you really

1293
01:27:04,144 --> 01:27:07,211
screw something up,
you can't fix it on your own.

1294
01:27:21,970 --> 01:27:23,570
Gotta go fast.

1295
01:27:24,330 --> 01:27:26,630
Don't tell me you've got a catchphrase.

1296
01:27:27,170 --> 01:27:28,290
That's right, new hedgehog.

1297
01:27:28,650 --> 01:27:30,290
And everyone loves it.

1298
01:27:31,870 --> 01:27:39,870
With that love, if you fail or if you
borrow With that love, you may never find

1299
01:27:46,630 --> 01:27:54,630
your way Oh yeah I will not try to stop my
elders from destroying the world.

1300
01:28:00,290 --> 01:28:02,550
Playtime is over.

1301
01:28:10,770 --> 01:28:13,250
There's no going back now.

1302
01:28:16,430 --> 01:28:17,830
Set.

1303
01:28:18,270 --> 01:28:18,410
Up.

1304
01:28:18,890 --> 01:28:19,890
Defense.

1305
01:28:21,330 --> 01:28:23,050
Damn you, autocorrect!

1306
01:28:28,510 --> 01:28:29,510
Mantis!

1307
01:28:34,750 --> 01:28:35,750
Neat.

1308
01:28:39,410 --> 01:28:41,510
I'm right here, arachnid.

1309
01:28:51,630 --> 01:28:54,750
That's what I call mantis-scaping.

1310
01:28:55,710 --> 01:28:57,510
That's elder abuse.

1311
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:10,800
Shadow, I see you've chosen betrayal.

1312
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,980
And you were once so useful to me.

1313
01:29:30,290 --> 01:29:32,850
Ready to recycle some tin cans?

1314
01:29:32,990 --> 01:29:34,030
Just trying to keep up.

1315
01:30:05,180 --> 01:30:06,680
Please, Grancy.

1316
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:08,660
Don't do this.

1317
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:10,260
Sorry, kiddo.

1318
01:30:11,080 --> 01:30:13,720
Bring your grandkid to work day is over.

1319
01:30:19,940 --> 01:30:21,940
Any last words?

1320
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:27,720
Just one thing that I never thought I'd
say.

1321
01:30:28,620 --> 01:30:29,620
What is it?

1322
01:30:30,260 --> 01:30:31,840
I love you.

1323
01:30:32,780 --> 01:30:33,780
No.

1324
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:35,780
It was something even better.

1325
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:38,800
But I'm not going to say it if that's the
way you're going to be.

1326
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:40,400
Okay, bye.

1327
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:54,800
Grandchildren.

1328
01:30:55,320 --> 01:30:58,620
All the fun and none of the
responsibility.

1329
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:03,400
Who said life was pointless?

1330
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:05,920
Oh, right.

1331
01:31:06,660 --> 01:31:07,660
You did.

1332
01:31:13,340 --> 01:31:14,340
Victory!

1333
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:16,520
See what you want about my granddad?

1334
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:18,920
He made one hell of a bug zapper.

1335
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:22,920
You've got to stop that laser.

1336
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:25,460
I knew there was something I was
forgetting.

1337
01:31:35,930 --> 01:31:37,310
We're out of time.

1338
01:31:37,950 --> 01:31:39,190
The cannon is about to fire.

1339
01:31:39,610 --> 01:31:40,610
Where are you?

1340
01:31:40,690 --> 01:31:42,730
Oh, you know, just making friends.

1341
01:31:43,550 --> 01:31:44,870
They're all yours.

1342
01:31:53,330 --> 01:31:54,690
Follow me.

1343
01:32:01,090 --> 01:32:03,670
Now this might hurt a little.

1344
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:19,920
So this was your plan?

1345
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:25,520
Would someone mind shutting down the giant
death ray?

1346
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:29,820
We can't stop the cannon from firing.

1347
01:32:30,140 --> 01:32:32,060
But we can steer it away from the Earth.

1348
01:32:32,460 --> 01:32:33,580
Coming around the starboard.

1349
01:32:33,780 --> 01:32:34,780
Aye, aye, doc.

1350
01:32:38,620 --> 01:32:40,020
Here we go.

1351
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:42,740
It's a little tight.

1352
01:32:43,740 --> 01:32:46,600
Definitely not power steering.

1353
01:32:52,220 --> 01:32:54,660
Keep turning.

1354
01:32:57,940 --> 01:32:59,740
Jump in any time here, guys.

1355
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:08,950
Oh, much longer.

1356
01:33:26,160 --> 01:33:27,160
Yes!

1357
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:28,640
I did it!

1358
01:33:29,320 --> 01:33:30,320
I did it!

1359
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:36,680
Look what you did!

1360
01:33:36,920 --> 01:33:38,480
Hey, look down there!

1361
01:33:38,860 --> 01:33:39,860
Sonic!

1362
01:33:45,910 --> 01:33:47,770
Knuckles, please tell me you have a...

1363
01:33:48,230 --> 01:33:49,230
Last one.

1364
01:33:49,750 --> 01:33:50,750
Let's make it count.

1365
01:33:53,450 --> 01:33:55,210
Ready for a little face of fall?

1366
01:33:56,410 --> 01:33:57,410
Deep breath.

1367
01:33:57,411 --> 01:34:01,030
One, two, three!

1368
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:23,400
Really?

1369
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:24,560
What's happening?

1370
01:34:24,940 --> 01:34:26,300
The reactor core is overloading.

1371
01:34:27,340 --> 01:34:29,520
It's only a matter of time before it
blows.

1372
01:34:30,200 --> 01:34:31,600
So what does that mean for Earth?

1373
01:34:32,240 --> 01:34:33,760
A radioactive atmosphere?

1374
01:34:34,820 --> 01:34:36,940
Rain that kills the crops and melts your
flesh?

1375
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:38,520
Other than that...

1376
01:34:38,860 --> 01:34:40,080
We're not done here.

1377
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:42,500
You try to stabilize the reactor.

1378
01:34:42,780 --> 01:34:43,800
Buy me some time.

1379
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:47,220
I'll push the station away from Earth
before it explodes.

1380
01:34:47,221 --> 01:34:49,260
Folks, this is our last chance.

1381
01:34:50,100 --> 01:34:51,980
To do the right thing.

1382
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:54,560
Let's do this.

1383
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:57,740
Let's do this.

1384
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:01,100
Core integrity failing.

1385
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:12,420
I got you, Sonic!

1386
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:45,930
Let's do this.

1387
01:35:45,931 --> 01:35:48,590
Initializing reactor core stabilizers.

1388
01:36:06,990 --> 01:36:09,670
This is Dr. Ivo Robotnik.

1389
01:36:10,450 --> 01:36:15,250
Dedicating my final live stream...
to one very special henchman.

1390
01:36:16,670 --> 01:36:17,670
Agent Stone.

1391
01:36:18,430 --> 01:36:18,910
No, no.

1392
01:36:19,410 --> 01:36:19,970
Doctor, wait!

1393
01:36:20,310 --> 01:36:25,210
If I can't rule the world...
I might as well save it!

1394
01:36:26,110 --> 01:36:28,790
You're the one and only person who ever
cared about me.

1395
01:36:29,250 --> 01:36:30,610
Don't do this, Doctor, please!

1396
01:36:31,510 --> 01:36:32,390
Stone... You're the one and only
person who ever cared about me.

1397
01:36:32,391 --> 01:36:34,550
You were more than a sick of it to me.

1398
01:36:38,810 --> 01:36:39,810
You were...

1399
01:36:40,240 --> 01:36:41,240
a sick of friend.

1400
01:36:47,130 --> 01:36:50,250
I'll miss your lattes with steamed
Austrian goat milk.

1401
01:36:52,350 --> 01:36:53,910
I love the way you make them.

1402
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:40,400
I guess there's only one thing left to
say.

1403
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:42,440
Hm?

1404
01:37:45,300 --> 01:37:46,800
It's been a real drag!

1405
01:37:47,740 --> 01:37:48,740
Thanks for nothing.

1406
01:37:52,740 --> 01:38:09,380
Sonic, look!

1407
01:38:19,050 --> 01:38:20,520
Shadow and Robotnik.

1408
01:38:21,080 --> 01:38:22,320
They sacrificed themselves...

1409
01:38:23,380 --> 01:38:24,500
to save everyone.

1410
01:38:26,135 --> 01:38:27,300
You always have a choice.

1411
01:38:29,620 --> 01:38:31,880
Guys, I'm really sorry for running off
like that.

1412
01:38:32,230 --> 01:38:33,551
I shouldn't have left you behind.

1413
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:39,940
The truth is... you're the best
teammates a hedgehog could ever ask for.

1414
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:42,540
And the best friends.

1415
01:38:43,680 --> 01:38:44,900
Can you ever forgive me?

1416
01:38:49,560 --> 01:38:50,560
Team Sonic?

1417
01:38:54,930 --> 01:38:57,040
How about just team?

1418
01:39:24,085 --> 01:39:25,085
Big finish!

1419
01:39:27,425 --> 01:39:29,740
Now that's what I call teamwork.

1420
01:39:30,680 --> 01:39:32,120
Okay, it's ready!

1421
01:39:35,080 --> 01:39:36,620
Knuckles, how could you?

1422
01:39:37,180 --> 01:39:38,660
Gotta be faster than that!

1423
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:40,920
Give me a break.

1424
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:42,921
I'm still moving a little slow over here.

1425
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:43,960
Donut Lord!

1426
01:39:44,100 --> 01:39:44,480
Yay!

1427
01:39:44,860 --> 01:39:45,500
Ahh!

1428
01:39:45,501 --> 01:39:46,840
Okay, Knuckles.

1429
01:39:47,080 --> 01:39:48,860
I am having the love.

1430
01:39:51,930 --> 01:39:52,960
Get in here Ozzy.

1431
01:39:53,570 --> 01:39:55,100
It's great to be back together.

1432
01:39:55,680 --> 01:39:56,840
We're stronger than ever.

1433
01:39:57,260 --> 01:39:59,380
And nothing is gonna stand in our way.

1434
01:40:01,480 --> 01:40:01,790
Except...

1435
01:40:02,100 --> 01:40:04,600
that one piece of unfinished business.

1436
01:40:13,540 --> 01:40:17,940
And way out in front to the surprise
of absolutely no one... It's the blue blur.

1437
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:19,860
Often imitated, never duplicated.

1438
01:40:20,060 --> 01:40:21,760
The one, the only...

1439
01:40:22,300 --> 01:40:23,460
Let's do this!

1440
01:40:26,900 --> 01:40:29,060
Alright boys, try and keep up.

1441
01:40:42,720 --> 01:40:44,740
Days like this don't get much better.

1442
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:46,540
Top down good fam, good weather.

1443
01:40:46,760 --> 01:40:48,420
Days like this we don't miss never.

1444
01:40:48,421 --> 01:40:49,820
Yeah, yeah.

1445
01:40:50,260 --> 01:40:52,160
Last night things got a little bit crazy.

1446
01:40:52,540 --> 01:40:53,880
Pulled up doing about 180.

1447
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:55,860
Life goes fast so there ain't no maybes.

1448
01:40:56,360 --> 01:40:57,160
Yeah, yeah.

1449
01:40:57,340 --> 01:40:58,140
Just give me that sunset.

1450
01:40:58,320 --> 01:40:59,100
Give me that ride.

1451
01:40:59,260 --> 01:41:00,120
Give me them stars out.

1452
01:41:00,220 --> 01:41:00,960
Four wheel drive.

1453
01:41:01,140 --> 01:41:01,940
Taking that back road.

1454
01:41:02,060 --> 01:41:03,060
Yeah, no lie.

1455
01:41:03,160 --> 01:41:04,660
Man, that sure feels nice.

1456
01:41:04,820 --> 01:41:05,660
Give me them real ones.

1457
01:41:05,780 --> 01:41:06,500
Ones I know.

1458
01:41:06,660 --> 01:41:08,280
Do a little two step do-si-do.

1459
01:41:08,520 --> 01:41:09,240
Turn it up loud.

1460
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:10,180
Bringing that crowd.

1461
01:41:10,360 --> 01:41:11,920
Take it up high and drive it low.

1462
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,520
We do this everywhere we go.

1463
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:15,580
I think you know.

1464
01:41:15,720 --> 01:41:17,420
This ain't no white horse rodeo.

1465
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:19,400
I think you know.

1466
01:41:19,540 --> 01:41:21,920
When we pull out the green lights I'll
show.

1467
01:41:22,180 --> 01:41:23,180
I think you know.

1468
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:24,900
That we go running, running, running.

1469
01:41:25,100 --> 01:41:26,720
Until we run out of room.

1470
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:28,040
Oh yeah.

1471
01:41:41,120 --> 01:41:42,120
Yeah.

1472
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:53,040
We do this everywhere we go.

1473
01:41:53,041 --> 01:41:54,140
I think you know.

1474
01:41:54,141 --> 01:41:56,840
This ain't no white horse rodeo.

1475
01:41:57,040 --> 01:41:57,820
I think you know.

1476
01:41:58,060 --> 01:42:00,500
When we pull out the green lights I'll
show.

1477
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:01,840
I think you know.

1478
01:42:01,900 --> 01:42:03,560
That we go running, running, running.

1479
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:05,460
Until we run out of room.

1480
01:42:12,760 --> 01:42:13,800
Oh yeah.

1481
01:42:17,260 --> 01:42:18,680
Running, running, running.

1482
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:20,840
Until we run out of room.

1483
01:42:21,020 --> 01:42:22,020
Oh yeah.

1484
01:42:25,150 --> 01:42:28,540
Sonic the Hedgehog is family champion once
again.

1485
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:30,400
Tails?

1486
01:42:31,480 --> 01:42:32,480
Knuckles?

1487
01:42:34,190 --> 01:42:34,640
Okay.

1488
01:42:35,105 --> 01:42:37,020
Yeah, I overshot the finish line.

1489
01:42:46,020 --> 01:42:48,780
Okay, so how do I get back?

1490
01:43:00,520 --> 01:43:01,520
Pro tip.

1491
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:05,060
If you're going to take a shot at the
fastest creature in the universe,
